<p>In fact, blue eyes in a cat come from two sets of genes, one that limits expression of color to specific body areas, the other that relates to the dominant white gene that masks color. Canines born with large patches of white on the facial area, particularly around the eyes, will often have blue eyes as a result of the distinct lack of pigmentation in that region. Almost any breed can turn out white with blue eyes if it is an albino. Have a quiet nature, love of the master. All pets, just like humans, will eventually have some health issues.</p>

Canines born with large patches of white on the facial area, particularly around the eyes, will often have blue eyes as a result of the distinct lack of pigmentation in that region. For instance, tabby persian cats are considered extroverts. Blue eyes are common in predominantly (solid) white cats and in cats with pointed markings. Your white breed cat may have one blue eye and one green or yellow eye.</p>
