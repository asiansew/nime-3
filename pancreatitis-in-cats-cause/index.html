<p>Pain can range from mild to severe. Pancreatitis is hard to detect in cats as it is likely to be more subtle in dogs. In fact, the definition of pancreatitis is “inflammation of the pancreas”. But if you see the symptoms in your cat, then you must get to a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Pancreatitis in cats may be either acute (arise suddenly and become pronounced quickly) or chronic (progressive or recurrent).</p>

<p>When the cause was identifiable (only about 15% of cases), the causes were general. The condition has been associated with cats ingesting poisons, contracting parasitic infections or experiencing trauma like a car accident. Pancreatitis affects cats of all ages, genders, and breeds equally, and less than two percent of cats will develop the disease. Acute pancreatitis is usually more severe than chronic. The exact cause of most feline pancreatitis cases is unknown.</p>

<p>However, it can occur in young cats and even kittens. Pancreatitis is hard to detect in cats as it is likely to be more subtle in dogs. Possible causes the specific causes of pancreatitis remain unknown. Most often, treatment is supportive, alleviating symptoms and keeping the cat comfortable. In many cases, no underlying cause for pancreatitis can be determined.</p>
