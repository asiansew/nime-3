<p>Early studies have found that cats are the animals most likely to catch the new coronavirus. Because chronic carriers of fecv tend to be asymptomatic, fecv can be assumed to be the cause of the diarrhea only after other causes (eg, infectious, dietary, inflammatory bowel disease, neoplasia, etc) have been excluded. In cats with the strain of feline coronavirus that can cause fip though, there are more severe symptoms. The wet form tends to progress more rapidly than the dry form, in either case, the body condition suffers, with the hair coat becoming rough and dull, and the cat becoming increasingly lethargic and depressed. Downing street has revealed the cat�s symptoms, while the rspca has issued advice and reassurance to pet owners.</p>
