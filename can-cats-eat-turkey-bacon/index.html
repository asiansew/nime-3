<p>Can i feed my cat raw bacon? Although ham is not the healthiest choice of meat that you can give your furry friend, your cat can still have ham. For one, only feed your cat fresh meat. And if dogs can eat bacon, what dos and don’ts should we keep in mind? Cats can eat turkey bacon but only as a small snack because its processing is a similar way as the one from pork and hence it has a lot of salt and may have other additives.</p>

<p>Create a square of woven turkey bacon slices by laying 5 slices of turkey bacon on a flat surface from north to south and 5 more from east to west then create a tight weave of turkey bacon. Both a raw and cooked turkey is safe for cats. Cats eating turkey bacon isn’t a better alternative to your usual bacon, either. These bacteria can disrupt their digestive system causing diarrhea or vomiting. Like cat treats, it is not a meal but a reward or treat.</p>
