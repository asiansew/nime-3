<p>Exotic looking, very affectionate and often, very vocal, the siamese is a very distinct breed of cat that is quite different to the average moggy, something that not all cat lovers are aware of when they first set their sights on. He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. The siamese cat’s personality is typically sociable and friendly. Hayes received a present in the form of a siamese cat. I think in general, siamese cats will do alright with dogs, once they are properly introduced.</p>
