<p>Canis from stray dogs in turkey. Rabies is endemic in turkish dogs and every year there are a small number of people who die from the bites of rabid dogs. The dogs — most of them purebred and trained — are either left in animal shelters or simply thrown out in turkey�s streets, which are already home to a large population of stray dogs and cats. This is an animal charity based in turkey. Cats are the most beloved animal in istanbul and the living attraction of this huge city.</p>

<p>Is one that doesn’t have a home. Sadly, the lifespan of stray cats is not very long. There is even a documentary on the stray cats of istanbul. People pet them, hold them, and feed them. For example, there is a story that the prophet muhammad found a cat had.</p>

<p>For example, there is a story that the prophet muhammad found a cat had. Additionally, lots of viral videos of animals in turkey have helped get their plight out into the world: No one knows how many street cats and dogs there are in turkey. They are extremely friendly, come in all sorts of cuddly colors and sizes, and always respond with a greedy “meow.” stray cats usually take the best seats at cafes and restaurants in istanbul without anyone even bothering moving them. As far as the garbage containers are concerned, the cats have the advantage over the dogs that can not jump into those.</p>

<p>All of these niceties reflect the warmth and kind nature of people in istanbul.needless to say, stray cats and dogs also face difficulties by living in the streets.

In istanbul alone, a megacity of 15 million people, there are thought to be 130,000 dogs and 125,000 cats roaming free. Sadly, the lifespan of stray cats is not very long.</p>
