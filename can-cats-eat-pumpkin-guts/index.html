The seeds pack a more significant caloric punch, as each ounce of kernels contains about 7 grams of protein and 13 grams of fat, yielding a hefty 151 calories in the same volume. Avoid any canned pumpkin products that contain added flavoring or sugars, especially if your cat has diabetes.</p>

<p>Pumpkin seeds are not poisonous to bunnies, per se, but they are not an ideal rabbit food. Don’t feed your animals raw pumpkin seeds. Your veterinarian can advise the specific quantity of pumpkin to serve, depending on your cat’s condition. A, b and c as well as zinc. If you are in the know about what pests and animals can attack or eat your pumpkins you can find ways to fend them off and protect your produce (and your dinner!).</p>

<p>Eating something out of the ordinary could be toxic for them. Do not add any salt or spices. Please only answer if you have personal experience with pumpkin and bunnies, or are a vet pet specialist. Some cats prefer the seeds, and some owners find it easier to crush them and add a little to their food. The parts that are still in good shape can be broken into chunks and fed to the chickens.</p>
