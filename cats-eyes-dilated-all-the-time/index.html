<p>Our vet has also reassured us that there is nothing wrong. He does have some health problems. I don�t know the maximum, but i�ll use some of my cats as an example. I am going to bring him into a vet i�m looking for a new one. He eats and drinks water, purrs a lot and still runs around and can jump up high.</p>

<p>Multiple health concerns are connected to dilated pupils. I shown a lamp in its face and no reaction almost. Or take her outside in your arms for a bit on a sunny day and see what they do.
