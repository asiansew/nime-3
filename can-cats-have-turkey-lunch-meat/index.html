<p>This includes both cooked turkey breast or sliced deli meat. Stay away from processed meats, making sure the turkey you feed your cat is always fresh. In this situation you would add approximately 1/8 of a cup as organ meat and the rest as muscle meat. The answer is yes, pieces of cooked turkey can be a healthy treat for cats. Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Onions are toxic to dogs, and garlic is potentially. Beef is another affordable meat option for cats. My dog josey loved chicken nuggets and one day i had gone to subway, got my fav freebie turkey sandwich, got it, chips home, on the platter, stupidly put the platter on the ottoman in the den, dash. Taurine is an essential amino acid. Smokey rushed to the turkey and gulpped it down.</p>

<p>I am going to add fish to this list, while it is okay to give a small amount of fish to your cat, it should be a sometimes food, and not a regular part of his diet. While cats can eat raw meat and there’s a general trend toward adding more raw meat to their diet, you run the risk of feeding your pet spoiled meat or food contaminated with salmonella or other bacteria. Bones from birds such as turkey, chicken, and duck are. I am going to add fish to this list, while it is okay to give a small amount of fish to your cat, it should be a sometimes food, and not a regular part of his diet. Ground beef must be cooked to 165 f.</p>
