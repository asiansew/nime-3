<p>Persian cats demand more care and attention. Although, cats have various colors like black, brown, gray or even orange but i love the white cat the most. There are some cat breeds that are accepted by the cat registries only if they are born with grey colored coat. Are you interested in adopting any of these fur babies? Here are our top 5 grey cat breeds:</p>

<p>Pure white cats are fairly rare in the general cat population, as they require a gene that hides every other possible coat color and pattern in a cat�s genetic makeup. The blue coat of these cats typically ranges from light ash gray to a steely, dark grey. A gray tabby cat makes a good housemate. The white parts are caused by the piebald or white spotting gene. Can my kitten be a bombay when all his siblings are tabby or gray.</p>
