<p>Report a stolen or lost pet on animal humane society’s lost/found bulletin boards. Please keep your eyes open for any of the pets shown below. The ottawa humane society will only use this information to contact you if we have further questions or if we have found the owner. Cats have a better chance of returning home on their own when they are left in the area in which they were found. There are concrete steps you can take to effectively recover your cat, but you must also be mindful to tailor your search to your specific cat.</p>
