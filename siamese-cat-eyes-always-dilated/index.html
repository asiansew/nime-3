Hair loss above a cat’s eyes (facial alopecia) commonly occurs as cats grow in size and the fur thins out. My kitty will be a year old in may. Although he�s white with an orange tail i think he might be part siamese because he�s got blue eyes that look red when light shines on them. Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right.</p>
<h3 id="dilation-should-be-an-exception-not-the-rule">Dilation should be an exception, not the rule.</h3><p>I am wondering why her pupils are dilated in light as well as dark conditions.

<p>When unequal pupils occur, the abnormal eye can be either the smaller (constricted) pupil or the larger (dilated) pupil. There may or may not be other symptoms present. During the day i have noticed his eyes are always dilated. Learn more about the symptoms and treatment of the condition here. My kitty will be a year old in may.</p>

<p>Now, back to my point. I do not have access to my email i have given you my husband’s email. My cat’s eyes are constantly dilated. She�ll barely wake up, and her eyes are dilated. If unequal pupils occur suddenly, bring your cat to a veterinary clinic or animal hospital immediately as eyesight can be permanently damaged if the problem is not rectified.</p>

<p>Cat owners always tend to be extremely close with their pets and there is always a lot of affection shown by both the owner and the cat, so you are always likely to notice any. Cat vision is designed to detect motion, which gives them an incredible advantage while hunting. Robin77, that photo really shows the difference doesn�t it? I have not called the vet yet. He has always had constantly dilated pupils (huge pupils).</p>
