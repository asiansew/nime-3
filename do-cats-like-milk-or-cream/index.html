<p>Therefore, milk for cats is like what red velvet cake is for humans: Milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt, ice cream all have different amounts. Another thing cats love is the cream of the milk. Some cats don’t like their water bowl too close to the food bowl, so try moving it a little further away. The two things are not really related.</p>

<p>There are cats that love milk. The milk we now buy in supermarkets contains little fat, and while some cats may like it for its taste, many do not find it easy to digest, dr.

For adult cats, treat milk replacers like any other dairy product: Not only can cow�s milk cause kitties to have diarrhea, it simply doesn�t offer any beneficial nutritional value to them.
