<p>Pvc is a type of plastic made of vinyl chloride that has been classified as “carcinogenic to humans” by the international agency for research on cancer. Rabbits have very sensitive gi microflora and if they ingest a lot of pine needles, they can develop severe diarrhea as a result. Artificial christmas trees contain toxins in the materials used to make the christmas tree. Real christmas trees are some version of pine, and pine can be very irritating. The needles can create more of an issue, as they are not easily digested and can cause gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, an obstruction, or perforate the intestines.</p>

<p>Sharp needles can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract if they are swallowed. Pvc is a type of plastic made of vinyl chloride that has been classified as “carcinogenic to humans” by the international agency for research on cancer. Unfortunately, this is the reality of the holidays for countless cat owners. She tells petcha that needles can puncture intestines, and an artificial tree�s needles can cause an intestinal blockage. I really think this information should have been shared.</p>

<p>Pvc is a type of plastic made of vinyl chloride that has been classified as “carcinogenic to humans” by the international agency for research on cancer. I could keep my cat mia downstairs for the whole of christmas. From the christmas presents, the christmas parties, the christmas cookies, and the christmas trees, it�s no wonder it�s considered the most wonderful season of all.but with all those good things come situations that test our merrymaking mettle. (and does your cat go along with what most cats do anyway?) there are two points of concern with eating needles from live christmas trees: Christmas tree dangers to cats.</p>

<p>Pesticides, fertilisers and tree preservers can leech out of the soil when the tree is watered which can pose a danger if the cat drinks the contaminated water. If you have a cat, which shows an interest in chewing your christmas cactus and displays any of the above symptoms we recommend you move the plant to an area (or room) your cat can’t access. Pine needles are mildly toxic. Several festive holiday plants found in the house around christmas time can also be hazardous for pets. However, there are some artificial christmas trees that are made of safer plastic such as polyethylene (pe).</p>
