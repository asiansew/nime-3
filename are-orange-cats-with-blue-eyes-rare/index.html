<p>Generally speaking, it�s not the breed but the colour and pattern that affect the eye pigmentation: Brought her in, made a home in a crate and proceeded to love her. My eyes are blue with a green ring around the iris. It is rare in adults or older kittens to be all red (orange) with any shade of blue eyes. While pedigreed black cats have a tendency towards bold orange eyes and white cats tend to have blue eyes, there�s very little to connect coat color with eye color.</p>

<p>It depends on the breed, a white cat with blue eyes may be a foreign white, khao manee, british shorthair, munchkin, sphynx, devon rex, cornish rex, maine coon, norwegian forest cat or a domestic (mixed breed). According to the aspca complete guide to cats, 17 to 20 percent of white cats with nonblue eyes are deaf; For a female cat to be orange, she must inherit two orange genes — one from her mother.

According to the aspca complete guide to cats, 17 to 20 percent of white cats with nonblue eyes are deaf; But if you have a red tabby kitten they may keep the blue eyes for about 2 months before they start changing to the adult color of green to gold, or a mix of both colors. The origins of the breed date back to 1984 when a tortoiseshell cat from a feral colony in new mexico produced a litter with intense blue eyes like hers. I have a blue girl with green eyes and in sun lite she looks lilac and silver.</p>

<p>Came home one day to find an adorable, tiny kitten in my driveway. Well, it’s not that orange female cats are rare, it is simply that an orange cat is more likely to be a male. The other 4 cats are burmese, two have what’s called milk chocolate coats, like the siamese dark points at ears, nose, paws and tail, both have yellow eyes one a boy the other a girl. While all kittens have blue eyes to start with, they will usually change to other colors as they grow up. Abraham.zoey on june 05, 2020:</p>
