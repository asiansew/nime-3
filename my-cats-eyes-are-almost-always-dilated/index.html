<p>I always have loved her eyes,shes the only cat i have with greenish eyes and the other night i was sitting playing my xbox with my lamp only on and i looked at her and 1 eye looks normal color and the other is a bright yellow/green like it looks like one eye is a flash light. For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying. He has always had constantly dilated pupils (huge pupils). Today, while i was walking my dog; I do not see the third eyelid.</p>

<p>Ive got a flame pint boy with big blye eyes whos always squinting n the sun and hispupils ar emuch. This of course was on a saturday afternoon so we took her to the emergency vet andshe said it was a knock on the head and after a week her eyes were normal again. Glaucoma in cats is a disease that involves increased pressure of fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). This change may be described as a “film” covering the cat’s eye or as an increased cloudy “whiteness” to the cat’s eye. Today, while i was walking my dog;</p>

<p>Our zebulon�s pupils never close to a slit like normal cat�s pupils do in bright light. He has always had constantly dilated pupils (huge pupils). She went on to tell me that he�s always super hyper, always has dilated eyes and thin. Cataracts are much less common in old cats than old dogs. However, if your cat has partial vision, it may mean there is a treatable problem present (such as high blood pressure), so get her checked by a vet.</p>

<p>Otherwise they are almost as big as her irises. But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings. I guess, it�s when they are uneven, one dilated the other not dilated, that there is cause for worry. Finally caught him and took him to the vet. The most serious of these are feline leukemia, toxicity, dysautonomia or tumors.</p>

<p>Multiple health concerns are connected to dilated pupils. Vet diagnosed him as having a heart murmur, possibly due to malnutrition as a little one. Learn more about the symptoms and causes of the condition here. Cats can develop cat eye problems not just from a direct problem with their eyes such as cat glaucoma or cat herpes, but also secondary to systemic cat diseases such as feline immunodeficiency virus or cat leukemia. Cat owners always tend to be extremely close with their pets and there is always a lot of affection shown by both the owner and the cat, so you are always likely to notice any.</p>
