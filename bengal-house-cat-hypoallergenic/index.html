<p>A lot of people are allergic to cats. Is a bengal cat hypoallergenic? In fact, most cats do not have hair fall and keep their coats all year round. All around the world, people prefer own bengal cats for their superior hygiene. We have kittens for sale all year long.</p>

<p>The bengal is also recognized by the american cat fanciers association, the canadian cat association and the united feline organization. They do seem to invoke less of a reaction in allergy sufferers. This means that there is less dander spread throughout the house because they do not lose that much fur. Knowing about bengals is crucial if you want to hold onto your furry little friend. For a bengal cat to be kind and affectionate, he must have been socialized and cuddled from an early age.</p>
