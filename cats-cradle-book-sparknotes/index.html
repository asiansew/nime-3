<p>Cat’s cradle is a remarkably discursive book, full of loose ends, unexplained events, and characters who appear in focus for a moment only to vanish without apology. Cat’s cradle(first published in 1963) is, perhaps, vonnegut’s most accessible novel and, unlike some of his other publications, does not seem to draw the ire of censors and detractors (although it does contain very brief mature language). In the biblical tale, jonah the prophet tried to resist. Felix�s total ignorance, indifference, and innocence toward the moral responsibility that accompanied his nuclear weapons research become even clearer in his attitude. It explores issues of science, technology, and religion, satirizing the arms race and many other targets along the way.</p>
