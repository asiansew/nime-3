Most importantly, raw sausage can be contaminated with bacteria, such as salmonella. I�d go to the store or the quick mart. The gravy isn�t bad for the cats per se, but it may be a little rich for them and upset their digestion and then you�d have a mess.</p>

<p>Cats cat eat deli meat, but it depends on what meat it is. Cats can eat plenty of human foods such as brown rice, meat, eggs, and vegetables. Did you know that a breakfast sausage can be as much as 50 percent fat? So, the bottom line on if cats can eat turkey? All food should be cooked before offering to your cat to prevent any potential diseases that can derive from poorly cooked meats.</p>

<p>Yes, your cat can absolutely share your turkey dinner — but with a few stipulations. Cats have trouble digesting the lactose in milk, which can cause an upset stomach or diarrhea. Be careful and don’t feed them raw meat, or you could make your cat sick. One of the main reasons sausage is bad for dogs is because it is so high in fat. Including chicken, beef, pork, fish, turkey, and lamb.</p>
