<p>This certainly seems to point to some genetic link between sex and coat markings, although veterinarians and researchers still haven’t seemed to pinpoint the exact factors. Yes, although the striping pattern is coded for by a completely different gene. Tabby is not a cat breed. Orange tabby cats are almost all male. Because in order for a male to be a calico, he must have.</p>

<p>Male orange tabby cats outnumber females approximately 4 to 1. Every cat is an individual, but orange cats have a reputation for being snuggly attention lovers. This is because the gene for the orange color is sex linked meaning it�s only present on the x chromosome. For reasons that are not fully understood, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male. Orange tabby cats are quite friendly, but not necessarily more friendly than other types of cats.</p>

<p>Because in order for a male to be a calico, he must have. Much like the comparison of male cats to female cats, it all depends on the factors surrounding their upbringing and breed. Below are a few of the common causes of feline uti: Males only have to inherit one orange gene to appear orange, while females have to inherit two. Personality varies from cat to cat, having little to do with coat pattern or color.</p>
