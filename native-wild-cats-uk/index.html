<p>Since the 1760s, when william cobbett, then a small boy, saw a large cat at waverley abbey near farnborough. The wildcat is britain�s only remaining native cat species. In british folklore, british big cats, also referred to as abcs (alien, or anomalous, big cats), phantom cats and mystery cats, are reports and incidents of felidae not native to britain but supposed to inhabit the british countryside. Jaguars normally hunt on the ground, but will also climb trees and pounce on their prey from above. The scottish wildcat, also known as the highland tiger, is the only native member of the cat family still found in the wild in britain.</p>
