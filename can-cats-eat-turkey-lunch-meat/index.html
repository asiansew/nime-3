<p>Vegetables that cats can eat. A little piece maybe as a treat, but don’t encourage it. So, the bottom line on if cats can eat turkey? This includes both cooked turkey breast or sliced deli meat. A regular diet of lunch meat is certain to cause health problems.</p>

<p>Is it bad for a dog�s health to basically feed her deli turkey for every meal? First, feed any turkey scraps in moderation, so your cat doesn’t have an upset stomach. A turkey allergy in cats will present itself as any other food allergy, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. However, remember processed meats are not necessarily good for a person’s health and likely aren’t great for cats, either, but a cat can eat them. Make sure you only feed your dog turkey meat.</p>
