<p>Walking your cat outside on a harness and leash can be a great compromise on the issue of outside vs. There are some ways to tone down the meowing and teach your cat that inside is great too. Cats scratching at your door. I’d also like to mention something even worse than cats meowing outside your door: Finally, you can try and give them a perch to sit on to look outside.</p>

<p>When your old cat meows all the time, especially loud yowling at night, there could be a serious health problem. Here’s what you should know. Unlike meowing, adult cats do yowl at one another, specifically during breeding season. All cats are going to meow to some extent—this is normal communication behavior. Cats also yowl—a sound similar to the meow but more drawn out and melodic.</p>

<p>Ageing can affect all of us, and cats are no different. I have found the best way to stop a cat meowing is with distraction. Some cats are more vocal than others. Oftentimes, excessive meowing or yowling can be one of the first signs of a disease. Any sudden change in behavior (including suddenly meowing to go outside more often) warrants a call to the vet to rule out medical issues before assuming the problem is behavioral.</p>
