Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few.</p>

You can give them a taste every now and then, but be careful about it. Splashing and pawing at streams of water probably have more to do with the play on light and shininess of the water than anything else. So, do you still want to give your cats some milk?</p>

<p>Whether it’s from a cow, goat, or mama cat, kittens and adult cats can and do drink milk. So, just like humans who are lactose intolerant, giving an adult cat milk can lead to stomach upsets. If they don�t like milk, they die. Some cats like milk so much that when it is offered to them by their human parents they will drink a lot. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they like it.</p>

<p>It always wants to curl up, so when it�s played with, it moves for them. Cats like milk because it is rich in fat. Any dairy will make them sick. Most cats love fish, and a little tuna or salmon can make a great treat. You can give them a taste every now and then, but be careful about it.</p>

<p>While some cats can develop lactose intolerance, so be careful, most cats enjoy dairy and cheese is a great source of fat and protein. A small amount can be used as a treat, something to give your cat as a reward or as part of holiday cheer. There’s also no denying that milk is a natural part of the feline diet—when it comes from mom. You can give them a taste every now and then, but be careful about it. Why do cats sleep so much?</p>

<p>Cats love the taste of milk because it is high in fat. Some keep making lactase into adulthood, particularly if they’ve been fed milk continuously since weaning and so their bodies have continued to produce lactase, and they can tolerate milk. Most cats love fish, and a little tuna or salmon can make a great treat. It always wants to curl up, so when it�s played with, it moves for them. Remember it’s a special treat, and not given often.</p>
