<p>Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. In some cases a completely white cat will have a gene with white spots resulting in “odd eyes” (one blue and the other gold or green). Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears.</p>

<p>Strangely, blue eye white cats tend to be deaf even more than others. In some cases a completely white cat will have a gene with white spots resulting in “odd eyes” (one blue and the other gold or green). Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf.</p>

<p>The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. Excellent at making friends, has congenial nature. Black and white cats with blue eyes have a much more common type of hearing and vision problem that may be related to their eye color. When one or both eyes are blue, anywhere from 60% to 80% of white cats will be deaf. You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate.</p>
