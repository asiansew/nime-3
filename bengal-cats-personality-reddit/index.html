Silver was introduced to the bengal cat in the 90s and is due to a cross with the american shorthair cat. If you get easily annoyed by a vocal cat, then the bengal breed may not be the right one for you to keep. These spotted felines, apart from being one of the smartest cat breeds, are incredibly playful and have high levels of energy they need to spend productively.all bengal cat owners know.</p>

<p>Show and breeder kittens are of varying prices according to quality. She is heavily boned with a long tail and a plush coat. Other times, a bengal is producing dander but an allergic person can better tolerate the dander itself. How much does a bengal cat cost? My f1 bengal, was way calmer and easier to live with.</p>

<p>A silver bengal cat is a little wonder with cold colors! This isn’t to dissuade you from getting a bengal, but they’re a lot of work, but i’ll try to answer your questions in the order they’re asked. W e all know that cats are renowned as smart and curious creatures, but bengals are a whole nother story. They are extremely curious, intelligent, playful, get into pretty much everything and require play activities to burn off some of their energy otherwise they will get into things around your home you might not appreciate. Many people allergic to cats are also allergic to dogs.</p>
