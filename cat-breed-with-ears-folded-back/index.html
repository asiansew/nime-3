<p>The scottish fold cat is not to be confused with the american curl, which also has folded ears. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in scotland�s tayside. The scottish fold is a relatively new breed that of course, originated in scotland. Depending on registries, longhaired scottish folds are varyingly known as highland fold, scottish fold lo Their origin is scotland, and they have folded ears.</p>

<p>All scottish fold cats can trace their lineage back to susie, the first cat known to have folded ears. Accordingly, it�s often recommended that a scottish fold is bred with a british shorthair to maintain its appearance, but broaden the gene pool. A shepherd discovered scottish cats in 1961. Again, they can be different depending on the breed. These playful and sociable cats love the company of humans, so they won’t enjoy being left home alone all day.</p>
