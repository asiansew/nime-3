<p>No, dogs should not eat onions. These types of mushrooms are edible, healthy, and harmless for both humans and pets. Some of the symptoms of hemolytic anemia in cats are: Dogs eat mushrooms for the same reasons they eat other odd things. They shouldn’t since they often have ingredients such as chives, onions, and garlic that are poisonous to kitties.</p>

<p>Cats can eat canned fish (they seem to go crazy over canned salmon and tuna), but it’s a less than ideal diet for them in the long run. One of the dangers of onions and dogs is that the toxins can build up in their system, meaning that they could slowly be reaching a point where an onion exposure could get them sick, or that there. A slice of green onion or a small clove of garlic may produce nothing more than minor digestive upset, but if eaten in sufficient quantities, foods in the onion family can cause your cat to develop anemia. Fat trimmings, raw meat, raw eggs and raw fish They contain lots of vitamins k, c and magnesium.</p>

<p>Canines, though, can resist the poisonous oxidant from onions better than cats. They can be fresh or frozen. Always keep fresh onions, onion powders, onion salts and other products containing onion out of your cat’s reach. However, as cats are obligate carnivores they should really only eat meat. Veterinarians caution against giving your cat or dog mushrooms.</p>
