As obligate carnivores, meat should form the majority of a cat’s diet. Onions are toxic to dogs, and garlic is potentially. So turkey can definitely become part of your feline’s meal times, although there are some safety considerations to take note of before you go ahead and serve up the bird. Beef is another affordable meat option for cats.</p>
