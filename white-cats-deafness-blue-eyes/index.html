<p>White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. It is this w gene which is the most prone to causing deafness in white cats. Albino cats are also incredibly sensitive to prolonged and intense sun exposure. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf.</p>

In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. Albino cats (red eyes due to c gene or blue due to k gene) totally or partially white cats (due to the s gene) all white cats (due to the dominant w gene) we find in the last group, those that are white due to the dominant gene w.</p>

Pointed cats, like siamese, who have a lighter body and darker extremities, always have blue eyes.</p>
