<p>A civet (/ ˈ s ɪ v ɪ t /) is a small, lean, mostly nocturnal mammal native to tropical asia and africa, especially the tropical forests.the term civet applies to over a dozen different mammal species. After about 24 hours, the coffee beans are defecated by the civet cats. The word “wild” has long since become a misnomer. Palm civets, also known as civet cats, are. After the civet excretes the berry in its feces, humans collect the dung, which is then washed so as to extract the berries, which are then ready for roasting and preparation as a beverage. However, the process made the coffee really rare and really expensive.</p>

The civet selects the ripest berries of the coffee plants from the old robusta coffee plants and eats the whole fruit. Luwak coffee is known as the most expensive coffee in the world because of the way the beans are processed and the limited supply.</p>

<p>A civet (/ ˈ s ɪ v ɪ t /) is a small, lean, mostly nocturnal mammal native to tropical asia and africa, especially the tropical forests.the term civet applies to over a dozen different mammal species. This, however, became an issue since the demand was high, but the quantity of civet coffee beans were low (very time consuming and unnatural process). In this process, the flesh of the coffee cherries are removed. The droppings are collected and the coffee beans are. Kopi luwak coffee is the world�s most expensive coffee.</p>

<p>This coffee is famous for its unique method of processing: Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it�s made from excreted arabica beans. Kopi luwak coffee is the world�s most expensive coffee. The whole process starts while the civet cat looks for food and end up eating the cherry on the coffee tree grown wildly or in the coffee plantation. Kopi luwak is an indonesian name that can be translated as a coffee from [the] luwak — an animal known as a civet cat, or more precisely, an asian palm civet, wrongly regarded as cat species though it is closer to mongooses.</p>

<p>Kopi luwak coffee is the world�s most expensive coffee. But how can the digestion process affect the coffee beans and dramatically improve their flavor? The process once the beans are ingested by the civet, the coffee beans go through an important transformation by enzymes contained in the civet’s body. However, the process made the coffee really rare and really expensive. It is made from beans that are collected from the feces of a palm civet cat.</p>

<p>Kopi luwak coffee is the most expensive, exclusive coffee in the world. After the civet excretes the berry in its feces, humans collect the dung, which is then washed so as to extract the berries, which are then ready for roasting and preparation as a beverage. The droppings are collected and the coffee beans are. But how can the digestion process affect the coffee beans and dramatically improve their flavor?
