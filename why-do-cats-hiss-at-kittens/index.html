Your cat will often act like they are upset at you too when you bring a new cat into the home. That is, it is thought to closely resemble the warning sound of a snake—a warning sound that is meant to dissuade predators. But then, we found a stray male kitten that needed a home.</p>

<p>Why do cats hiss at new kittens? When a cat feels threatened, they’ll release a burst of air through their mouth, and it’s this burst of air that makes a hissing sound. Your cat might hiss at the new kitty to let him know that she is the dominant cat in the house. I fed a million feral cats over the years and i know they reject their own kittens once they grow a bit older. Your reaction may be to approach or reprove the cat, but his hissing action should override your impulse.</p>

<p>That is, it is thought to closely resemble the warning sound of a snake—a warning sound that is meant to dissuade predators. After much research, i got to know the real reason. This could be brought about by an oncoming stray cat or stranger. A mother cat will hiss at her kids to warn them of impending danger. Primarily, mothers hiss so that kittens can learn to mimic the sound.</p>

<p>Read on to find out how and why cats hiss and what you should do when they hiss at or around you. The humane society says that cats have a wide variety of vocalizations that they use for communicating, both with other cats and with humans. Your reaction may be to approach or reprove the cat, but his hissing action should override your impulse. Growling and hissing are both very common ways that cats communicate. It’s a common response to feeling threatened.</p>
