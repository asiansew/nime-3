However, it is better to provide your cat with water because it is a natural constituent part of an adult cat�s diet whereas milk is not. Cats like fatty, viscous milk, and tradition. If a cat chooses a puddle over fresh water, it often means there’s something wrong with the location, type of water, or the bowl itself. In the wild, you will often see cats dragging their food away from water sources.</p>

<p>The water bowls should be in an appealing place far from your cat�s food or litter box. Cats who eat wet food will require less water, but you should always have it available for your feline friends no matter what type of food you feed your healthy cat. Now that you know the answer to the question of, “can cats drink milk,” is “no,” make. Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few.

<p>Pay attention to where your cat drinks. Well, every cat is prone to be loving a dairy lover, especially because they are a mammal. You can offer small amounts as a treat. This way, she won�t fear. If they are older and have been weaned, then they can eat canned or dry food and drink water.</p>

<p>It is true that some cats like milk and are better able to tolerate lactose than others. Cats can have rice milk and coconut milk, also in very limited amounts. The domestic cat�s liking of milk is legendary. Make sure your cat can see you move the water to a new location, away from the food or litter box.

<p>The problem with soy milk is that it has a lot of calories, and it usually contains potentially dangerous ingredients, too, like sweeteners or additives to extend their shelf life. Cats don�t generally like to drink water near where they eat. While some cats don�t care if their water is close to the litter box or food bowl, others are particular about having them close to the water. Therefore it is probably fair to say that cats prefer milk to water. I use to give my cat milk only once every few weeks and sometimes months, because milk can sometimes make a cat sick, but milk for a cat once in a while wont hurt them wether than giving the cat.</p>

<p>People joke that only pampered pets got bottled water. Cats do like milk, but, like all animals, feeding them milk will make the very, very sick. Kittens drink their mother’s milk when they are young, so drinking milk probably brings back feelings of comfort, safety, and protection. Cats can have rice milk and coconut milk, also in very limited amounts. Cats can have soy milk in moderation.</p>
