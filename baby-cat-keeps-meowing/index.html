<p>Your cat simply wants attention. He thinks every thing i open he thinks it’s his treats. If your cat is used to getting what they want from meowing, they are going to meow more, and louder, when it quits working. Get a cardboard box for him.the cat will eventually get his confidence up and stop meowing so much. It can take weeks, sometimes months, to get rid of this behavior if it’s been going on for a while.</p>

<p>If your cat keeps meowing, walk away until they calm down. There is a difference between a kitten meowing from the time he moves into his new home to a usually quiet kitten who suddenly becomes vocal, the latter could be due to either sickness (some cats can meow more when they’re not feeling well), or if you have a female cat, she could have come into heat. Hey people, i would like to ask your advice on something. But your sweet new kitten may cry often, which can cause you distress. Unless the cat has a bad case of worms or fleas,he/she shouldn�t cause any health issues.</p>

<p>When he stops,bring out some wand toys and treats. We know that cats are capable of making a huge variety of noises. To avoid contstant meowing, put your kitten in a small and warm room, feed it, play with it, and show it its litterbox. Walking away is for excessive meowing, but do be sure to spend time with your cat every day (they are part of your family, after all). Get a cardboard box for him.the cat will eventually get his confidence up and stop meowing so much.</p>
