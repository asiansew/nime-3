Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. There are more orange tabby males than females. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. The colors are often described as red and black, but the red patches can instead be orange, yellow, or cream, and the black can instead be chocolate, gray, tabby, or blue.</p>

<p>This certainly seems to point to some genetic link between sex and coat markings, although veterinarians and researchers still haven’t seemed to pinpoint the exact factors. One is solid orange and male. The ‘ginger gene’ which produces the orange colour is on the x chromosome. When two orange tabbies breed, all of their offspring, male or female, are orange tabbies. They hardly come in solid orange.</p>

<p>It�s all thanks to their genetic makeup. My orange female cats are more playful than my orange male cats. About 20% of orange tabbies are estimated to be female. He was born on a welcome mat (he still uses to nap on) in my kitchen. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, xx, and male cats have xy sex chromosomes.</p>
