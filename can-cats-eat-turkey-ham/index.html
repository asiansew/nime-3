<p>Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store. The most suitable cured meats for cats are sliced turkey and ham, both low in salt if possible. This question doesn�t come with the simplest answer. You should also keep in mind that too much ham is not good for your cat’s health. Many pet owners are not in the favor of serving ham to dogs in any form.</p>

<p>But my human mom told the little ones not to feed me any holiday ham or turkey. I guess this has already been established at the beginning. Ham contains high levels of sodium, which is not good for cats. If your cat has never had turkey before, he can be hesitant. Although cats love them, cured meats should only be given on occasion.</p>
