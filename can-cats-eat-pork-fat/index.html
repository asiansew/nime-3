<p>The meat of pigs is very high in sodium and fat which are two of the things cats don’t really need. Do not add smoked or salted meats to your cat’s diet due to the presence of nitrates, sodium, preservatives and smoke flavors which will harm your feline friends. It’s not the pork that’s the problem; If you want to know about what cats can or cannot eat. We should not feed it.</p>

<p>Table scraps often contain fat trimmed off of meat and bones. This fat is wildly unhealthy, especially for a body as small as a cat�s. Pork is not toxic to cats, but the issue is that it is high in sodium and fat, which are two nutrients cats don’t need. So, can cats eat bacon? Even turkey bacon, which is considered a healthier alternative to pork bacon, contains high levels of grease and sodium that can be detrimental to your kitty�s health.</p>
