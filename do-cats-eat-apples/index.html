<p>Cats are obligate carnivores and do not need apples as part of their diet. Which means apples are the food may be a bit hard to digest for cats, especially for the miniature cats. The majority of cats won’t be interested in apples, especially on their own. That said, apples can still make for decent, if only occasional, snacks. The flesh of apples is high in calcium, vitamin c, vitamin k, and pectin, and the skin is high in phytonutrients.</p>
