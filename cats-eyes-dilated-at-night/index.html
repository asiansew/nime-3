<p>Before we start please note: Its the lense at the front of the eye. Cats� big ol� pupils aren�t just for seeing mice at night. Cats have evolved to hide signs of illness and pain. So even in a bright room, the eyes stay dilated.</p>

<p>Hypertension, commonly referred to as high blood pressure, is a very common physiological culprit of dilated pupils. Cats can develop everything from viral infections in their eyes to glaucoma. If a cat�s eyes are dilated all the time, the situation might require a visit to the vet. Kitty doesn’t need to vocalize to get her message across, although the intent often is reinforced with tail talk , ear positions, and fluffed fur. My cat�s eyes are very dilated.</p>

<p>Disease is frequently detectable simply by examining the eyes with a light and a series of lenses (an ophthalmoscope). Cats can expand their pupils any time, day or night, in light or dark. Cats have evolved to hide signs of illness and pain. Though eye disease is less common in cats than dogs, you should rush to the vet as soon as you can if your cat’s eye or eyes appear cloudy. His eyes look sort of cloudy, but it�s not cataracts.</p>
