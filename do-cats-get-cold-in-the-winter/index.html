<p>If you check out any of the cat registries, most of the shows are in the late autumn and winter months simply because that�s when cats are in full coats. The average indoor cat eats around 15% more during the winter months. Feral cats will be looking for food resources and warm shelter to protect them from the cold of winter. During periods of cold weather, cats will go looking for a warm place to hunker down. So what should you do when you see a cat outside during the winter?</p>

<p>Cats seek relief from most of the same cat cold symptoms as we do, including watery eyes, a runny nose, fever, sneezing, loss of appetite and a feeling of lethargy. Without the opportunity to bask in the sunlight, a cat has a lower body temperature. The average indoor cat eats around 15% more during the winter months. The cool winter weather not only impacts our lifestyle, it affects our feline friends too. Give the gift of warmth.</p>

<p>Another common reason for low body temperature in cats is wet fur. You’re not imagining things as cats do eat more in the winter. Cat colds typically last from one to four weeks depending on how quickly they’re diagnosed and treated. Be particularly gentle with elderly and arthritic cats during the winter. There are a number of options for providing community cats with adequate shelter during the winter months.</p>

<p>If you�ve noticed your feline pal sleeping more lately, it might just be more than cold weather laziness (which we could totally relate to). This will ensure your cat has a place to rest and keep themselves warm Especially if the you have gone out for work and the heating is not switched on. This cycle applies much more to cats who spend time outdoors. Unfortunately, like us, our feline friends can get colds too.</p>
