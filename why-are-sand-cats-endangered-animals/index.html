They are also known for being snake hunters, which they kill with a rapid blow to the head that stuns, and then administer the death bite to the neck.</p>

<p>The researchers believe this is the first time anyone has filmed sand cat kittens in the wild. The main threat to sand cats is loss of habitat and prey species as humans move into their territory. This animal’s sand colored coat is hard to see against dry bushes and sand, and acts as protection for it. The sand cat (felis margarita), also known as the sand dune cat, is a small wild cat living in sandy and stony deserts far from water sources. Snakes, owls and jackals are the major threat for the sand cat.</p>
