<p>The colors are often described as red and black, but the red patches can instead be orange, yellow, or cream, and the black can instead be chocolate, gray, tabby, or blue. Yes i do know for cetain that orange cats are more likely to be male, however there is genetic reason the cat can�t be female, it just more likely to be male. In fact, up to 80 percent of orange tabbies are male, making orange female cats a bit of a rarity.

<p>This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. Up to 80% of orange cats are male and nobody knows why. According to the bbc’s focus magazine, the ginger gene in cats works a little differently compared to humans; Solid orange simply is not a color trait found in cats. Abyssinians are favored for the orange ticked pattern.</p>

Yes i do know for cetain that orange cats are more likely to be male, however there is genetic reason the cat can�t be female, it just more likely to be male. If orange cats are usually male, and both black and orange are sex linked, does that mean most black cats are usually male too? In fact, up to 80 percent of orange tabbies are male, making orange female cats a bit of a rarity. Although some red cats (usually dilutes) may appear to be a solid color, upon closer examination, you will see the pale stripes, whorls, or spots of the tabby.</p>
