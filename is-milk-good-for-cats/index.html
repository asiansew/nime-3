<p>The test to know if the cat is one of them is simple: Why cats shouldn’t drink milk. When serving milk to your cat, don’t overestimate the portion size. Try offering your cat a tablespoon or two of milk. If your cat seems ok after having a saucer of milk, and there are no signs of vomiting, diarrhea, or discomfort, it’s a good sign that it’s fine as an occasional treat.</p>

<p>It is very rare for cats to have problems with this food, so this might be the reason some people are asking the question “is soy milk dangerous for cats?”. However, milk does not contain many amino acids. While the majority of cats are lactose intolerant, there are those who love their milk. “we generally recommend that cats be fed no more than 20 to 30 calories a day from unbalanced sources, such as human food. However, even kittens don’t deal that good with cow milk, so they should avoid drinking cow milk the same as adult cats.</p>

In fact, it can cause a series of ailments, including an upset stomach, cramps, and severe diarrhea. Try offering your cat a tablespoon or two of milk. Most cats are lactose intolerant, like some humans. To be able to digest dairy milk, cats have to be ‘equipped’ with an enzyme known as lactase enzyme.</p>
