By nadine oraby | 2020 update. Tail wagging is an instinctive behaviour that develops between 3 and 4 weeks of age depending on your dog’s breed, and is one of the primary communication methods to both other dogs and people.while it’s commonly thought that dogs wag their tail to show they are happy, it can be for other reasons as well such as nervousness and excitement.</p>

<p>Dogs do use their tails to communicate, though a wagging tail doesn�t always mean, come pet me! dogs have a kind of language that�s based on the position and motion of their tails. Cats are common pets that are beloved by many people. A cat wagging her tail is not a sign of her being content, but due to other mixed emotions. When your cat is frightened, their tail will wag in a low position. Cats communicate mostly through body language and their tails are a big part of that.</p>

<p>We often see dogs move their tails as a sign of communicating what they want. The wag is observed when a cat becomes tired of play or petting. Tail wagging is how cats communicate with one another and also their body language. Cats communicate with a number of different movements. If a cat wags his tail, it could mean that he�s about to get aggressive with another cat.</p>
