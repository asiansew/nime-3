<p>Some breeders have begun breeding smaller wild species with domestic cats to create beautiful hybrids that are safe for the average cat owner to live with. Although hybrids are still controversial, there is no denying how unique and beautiful they are. While we know that lions and tigers have yet to get frisky in the wild, it’s certainly possible for two species to produce a hybrid in nature.

<p>7 most popular hybrid cat breeds. Hybrid cats can occur naturally. Although hybrids are still controversial, there is no denying how unique and beautiful they are.

<p>Most, like the margay, are relatively small. Hybrid cats are known for being extremely destructive. Some breeders have begun breeding smaller wild species with domestic cats to create beautiful hybrids that are safe for the average cat owner to live with. Natural hybrids are either a cross between two different species of wild cat or a cross between a wild cat and a feral domestic cat. However, there is an expanded definition of big cats that includes the cheetah, snow leopard, cougar (mountain lion/puma), clouded leopard and sunda clouded leopard.</p>
