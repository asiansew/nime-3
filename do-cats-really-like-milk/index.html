<p>Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. Cats, in fact, do enjoy music, but they don’t enjoy human music — at least according to new research. While events like this are adorable, you might wonder if cats really can drink milk. Every cartoon says cats love milk, yes the kinda do but it isn t good for some of them. He would sit at the fridge in the morning waiting for it.</p>

<p>Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. Do cats really need to drink milk? You can give these as treats, but “in general, there is no reason to use them unless the cat has developed an unusual taste for them, wynn says. On farms, when milk came straight from the cow, the fattier cream rose to the top. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they like it.</p>

<p>But, is that really so? You can offer small amounts as a treat. Cats drinking milk is typically the stuff of storybooks and movies — a child rescues a cat, and the first thing they do is feed it a shallow saucer of creamy milk. On farms, when milk came straight from the cow, the fattier cream rose to the top. The traditional image of a contented cat lapping from a bowl of milk is a misleading one.</p>
