<p>£13.58 to… £24.76 advocate small cat for cats weighing less than 4kg in weight, contains 0.4 ml (40 mg imidacloprid, 4 mg moxidectin) and is a broad spectrum combination treatment, effective against fleas,. Advocate is for dogs who are suffering or are at risk from internal and external parasitic infections. While some cats don�t seem to react at all others definitely do and reading the reviews here applying this stuff seems to be playing russian roulette with your cat�s life and i will never do that again. The content of a full pipette is applied onto the animal’s skin, after parting the fur. Each screw cap pipette contains a solution containing imidacloprid and moxidectin which presents in a yellowy/brown liquid.</p>

<p>Advocate is a combined flea and worm spot on treatment that not only kills fleas but also hookworms, roundworms, heartworm and otodectes ear mites. Lungworms can cause debilitating illness in cats characterised by respiratory compromise, and may be fatal. The last time i used it, about a week ago, one cat is ok, but the other has been very poorly ever since. Advocate spot on for cats comes in different strengths and pack sizes, depending on whether it is for use on cats, on ferrets, or on dogs, and on the size of the animal being treated. I have used advocate on my 2 cats recently as advised by the vet.</p>

<p>The contents of one pipette are applied to the skin on the back of the neck between the parted hair. We use advocate for the dog and the cats once a month. The last time i used it, about a week ago, one cat is ok, but the other has been very poorly ever since. Treatment is usually given every 4 weeks. The first couple of times, both cats were �low� for a couple of days, i put it down to sulking.</p>
