<p>In truth, there is no such thing as truly hypoallergenic cat. It means that they produce fewer allergens. Oriental longhair cats are the first cats in western europe. They do not come from the himalayans but rather were named himalayan because of their coloring that is the same as that of the. As compared to domestic cat breeds, siamese cats are hypoallergenic.</p>

<p>The siamese cat’s seal point coloration was first seen in a kingdom’s royal court as they play the role of a royal feline in the kingdom of siam (now called thailand). Often referred to as the “longhaired siamese,” the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed. The reason for this mixture in traits is because himalayan cats are originally hybrids of persian and siamese cats. Temperature is so vital to point coloration as cats that live in cold environments will actually show darker points and cats in warmer environments are paler. As himalayans are longhaired, some people think they will be somehow less predisposed to cause allergy.</p>

<p>Siamese cats have unique himalayan genes and that is why they have a long, silky coat which does not make them a good candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed. The birman, himalayan, persian breeds are the least reactive breeds as a whole in my opnion. Individuals with severe cat allergies should still be cautious around siamese cats. Although its short hair can cause an allergic reaction, finding a lot less hair in the home really helps those people who are sensitive to feline allergens to not develop symptoms. Though there’s no guarantee you won’t.</p>
