<p>The virus is extremely resilient and can survive in the environment for long periods of time. The virus is resistant to disinfectants and can survive for years on contaminated surfaces. The virus can also be carried on shoes and clothing, increasing the chance that it can spread to indoor cats. Distemper is commonly found where there are many cats in. While dogs cannot catch feline parvovirus, the virus can mutate and be spread to cats.</p>

<p>Many pet owners and some veterinary professionals are increasingly concerned about the risk of overvaccination, and are choosing to vaccinate owned animals less frequently—or even not to vaccinate. It weakens the immune system, causing a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which are essential in combating the disease. The parvo virus in dogs is very closely related to the virus panleukopenia: [7,8] young kittens (3 to 6 months of age) are especially vulnerable. Since parvovirus b19 only infects humans, a person cannot get the virus from a dog or cat.</p>
