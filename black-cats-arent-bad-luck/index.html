<p>They say it is bad luck because i the olden days when they saw a black cat they thought it was evil cause there ears. A black cat can be good luck or bad. Black is associated with darkness and evil. That�s bad luck! and my stepdad�s answer was only if you�re prey and immediately got his foot caught on her and landed in the wet grass. We are black cats, but we aren�t bad luck and we definitely aren�t evil.</p>

<p>In the united states, it seems that black cats have been synonymous with bad luck for a great number of years. I�m a little bit evil. In the 17th century, black cats roaming at night were thought to be witches using them to travel more secretly. We bet you wish you hadn’t crossed the street to avoid that black cat now. In fact, in a lot of places and cultures, they’re actually a symbol of good luck and prosperity.</p>
