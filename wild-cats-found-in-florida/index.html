<p>About the classification of the wild cat species (taxonomy). The thick furs, long legs, and massive paws of the species help it adapt to the cold environment of its habitat. Of the six species of wild cats found in north america, only the jaguar is of genus panthera, and therefore considered to be a ‘big cat’. There is even a cougar named the “florida panther. Panther is one of the cougar’s many names.</p>

<p>Florida panthers and bobcats are the only two wild cats found in florida and panthers are by far the larger of the two. I have never seen one in the wild and i have spent a lot of time in the woods. Lynx canadensis is one of the small wild cats living in north america. They are critically endangered and fewer than 100 survive. The florida bobcat is about twice as big as a domestic cat and is easy to identify thanks to its short bobbed tail.</p>

<p>The mountain lion is the most exciting of big cats, as it tends to be the object of folklore and a symbol of our anxieties in big and wild spaces. “cougar,” “puma,” “panther,” “catamount,” and “mountain lion” are all terms that can be used interchangeably for this, the largest of north america’s regularly occurring big cats. It is bordered by the pacific ocean (south), atlantic ocean (east), arctic ocean (north), south america and the caribbean sea (southeast). Florida panthers are much rarer to see than bobcats and are protected under the endangered species act. The florida panther refuge provides habitat for a total of 126 bird species, 46 species of reptiles and amphibians, 22 species of mammals and a large variety of fish.</p>
