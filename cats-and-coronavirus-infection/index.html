Feline coronavirus is a virus that usually only produces very mild symptoms in cats.the coronavirus can lead to a condition in cats known as feline infectious peritonitis (fip), although it is extremely rare. Owning cats or other pets was not linked to heightened odds of the infection. Feline enteric coronavirus typically causes a subclinical or mild, transient intestinal infection in kittens.

<h3 id="owning-cats-or-other-pets-was-not-linked-to-heightened-odds-of-the-infection">Owning cats or other pets was not linked to heightened odds of the infection.</h3><p>Cats are susceptible to natural infection with several strains of feline coronavirus that may result in either effusive and noneffusive fip disease or in subclinical to severe enteritis. In cats with the strain of feline coronavirus that can cause fip though, there are more severe symptoms. A study of feral cats in wuhan, not yet peer reviewed, showed that some had antibodies to the coronavirus, indicating some level of exposure to the virus and some response by their immune systems. Cats, however, do develop a strong, protective immune. A new scientific report confirms that cats and dogs can be infected by the novel coronavirus, and that neither animal is likely to get sick.
