So if your cat is kneading your lap, sit back and relax… because that�s likely what she�s preparing to do. Why do cats knead blankets and… your belly? Now that you know why they do this, let me explain other reasons why they knead in this way.</p>

<p>Cats actually start to knead instinctually as kittens, when they are nursing, to help stimulate their mothers� milk. So if your cat is kneading your lap, sit back and relax… because that�s likely what she�s preparing to do. It can be part instinct and part habit, and it will last his lifetime. Kneading objects is typically associated with cats, but many dogs knead as well. Adding further weight to the explanation.</p>

<p>When kneading, cats are in a happy, contented state and will often be purring. While kneading doesn’t always yield milk, adult felines may always associate the motion with the comfort of nursing. Mother cats may knead on blankets to form them into a nest for their kittens. In an ideal world, kittens stay with their mothers until they’re at least eight weeks old. Long after they�ve left their mothers� sides, cats continue to knead.</p>

<p>Kneading may have an origin going back to cats� wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest. As i grew up we used to have this weird habit of eating peanuts and shaking the salt off them. In an ideal world, kittens stay with their mothers until they’re at least eight weeks old. While kneading doesn’t always yield milk, adult felines may always associate the motion with the comfort of nursing. When cat suckling behaviors occur in adult cats, though, it tends to gets more attention and can be viewed as abnormal.</p>
