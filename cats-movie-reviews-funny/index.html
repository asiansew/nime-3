<p>Dec 20 2019, 7:23 pm est there. Cats may very well be the most unique film of the year, certainly released by a major studio, and you�ll love it and hate it but you sure won�t forget it.

The internet was immediately perplexed when the cats trailer premiered in july, and now that people have seen it, it doesn�t appear reception has warmed at all. We gotta say though, some of these reviews are so ridiculous that they almost make us want to go watch the movie. The cats movie reviews have come out and they are savage. “cats” the movie is deeply, deeply weird, and not in a good way, writes our movie critic, who admits to being hopelessly fond of both cats in the abstract and this musical specifically.</p>
