Raw eggs are not good for cats. In fact, eggs can also be a great source of protein for cats. However, to avoid the potential of salmonella poisoning, make sure the shells are boiled first, and then crush them into small pieces (a coffee grinder works great) before sprinkling.</p>

<p>How long do you bake eggshells for chickens? Dogs and cats alike will benefit from the natural nutrients found in eggshells, without any of the additives found in many commercial supplements. Dogs can eat a boiled egg with the shell. The best way to feed eggshells to your cat is to grind them into a fine powder that you can mix in with their food. Some even consider eggs to be a superfood for cats.</p>

<p>Some even consider eggs to be a superfood for cats. Dogs and cats alike will benefit from the natural nutrients found in eggshells, without any of the additives found in many commercial supplements. Note that if the shells are not well ground or digested, white flecks of these shells may be present in your dog. It is okay to give your kitten eggs, but you should do so in small amounts, and just every once in a while. Cats won’t eat the turtle’s shell, but cats can eat the turtle’s meat.</p>

<p>Whether you have a dog, a cat or both, using ground eggshell is an easy and highly nutritious approach to calcium supplementation. According to petmd, there is some evidence to suggest that eggshells could provide health benefits to cats, namely in the form of calcium. Eggshells actually offer a number of nutritional benefits for your cat. Just make sure not to overdo it. And, just like in humans, eggs have great health benefits … including that they are great source of protein!</p>
