<p>Bengals have a wild appearance; The first cat association to recognize the bengal was the international cat association, which granted the breed experimental status in 1983, followed by full recognition in 1991. The bengal cat with require attention from their owner and want to spend time with them and will likely not be the cat that is constantly hiding under the bed. If you are looking for an active and inquisitive pet with an innate curiosity to explore new things and places, then the mix is for you. Bengal cats have a ridiculous amount of personality.</p>
