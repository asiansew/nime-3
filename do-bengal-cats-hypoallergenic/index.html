<p>It means relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. in comparison to other cat breeds, bengal cats are less likely to cause an allergic reaction in people, and here is why. The bengal’s coat is more like pelt, their hair thick, short and compact. Are bengal cats good house pets? No matter how you look at it all cats, including bengal cats do produce some sort of dander, so this means that you will never find a cat that is totally free of dander or is a totally allergen free cat. These quiet and affectionate cats have a lifespan of 12 to 16 years.</p>

<p>Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. The answer is probably in their fine coat, which is so fine it doesn’t require much grooming or maintenance by the bengal. Why do people think cats are 100% hypoallergenic. Their tight sleek pelt may produce less dander or hold fewer allergens. Breeding for hypoallergenic qualities in cats requires decreasing the feline’s production of a particular protein found to be the culprit in triggering human allergies in susceptible individuals.</p>

<p>People probably think cats can be 100% hypoallergenic because they don’t know the science behind what makes their nose twitch. With this in mind, yes, bengal cats are hypoallergenic! Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. These allergy free cats have an average lifespan of 14 years. Bengal cats are one of the most hypoallergenic cats.</p>
