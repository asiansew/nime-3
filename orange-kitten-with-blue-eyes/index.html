<p>The orange fur is determined by a gene located on the x chromosome. Glee dango (reboot) orange kitten is a kitten currently attending miss marigold�s preschool class along with blue, magenta, purple kangaroo, green puppy, and periwinkle (according to blue takes you to school ), conveniently named after her color and species. Then i googled if it was rare, and they say both parent have to be red so there would could be a red orange female, but her parents were orange (father) and dark grey. She one of blue�s best friends. Let’s be honest, a fluffy orange kitten alone would be enough to melt your heart.</p>

<p>She one of blue�s best friends. This could possibly be the cutest baby you’ll see today, or maybe the you’ve seen in a while… just take a deep breath, and let those.
