<p>What color kittens will these cats have? If a mother cat is orange, her male kittens will be orange regardless of their father’s color, konecny says, and if a mother cat is tortoiseshell (a mix of black, white and orange), half of her male kittens will be orange while the other half will be black. This is known as superfecundation. If you happen to own an orange cat or kitten who is a girl cat, you have a very special kitty on your hands! Kittens can have different fathers. Since the orange gene is recessive and carried only on the x chromosome (let�s call it x°), and orange male is x°y and and orange female is x1°x2°.</p>
<h3 id="i-saw-her-be-with-4-different-cats-all-the-in-3-days">I saw her be with 4 different cats all the in 3 days.</h3><p>The genes that cause the suppression of color are stronger than the genes for any color including the mighty orange. Please note, these cats are from rescues and shelters nationwide and are not available through the aspca. 2 males and 1 female, lazy you say, not a chance here. Search by zip code to meet available cats in your area. Since white isn’t a color and is merely hiding the genes for color, white cats often produce colored kittens. Then i googled if it was rare, and they say both parent have to be red so there would could be a red orange female, but her parents were orange (father) and dark grey.</p>

<p>I think they are including orange and white as well. This is because the gene that causes a cat to be orange is linked to sex, and statistically most orange cats are boys. No shots or deworming (could do for extra cost) To get an orange female kitten, both the mother and father must be orange, konecny says. Orange cats can have long or short hair.</p>

<p>In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. All orange cats have stripe patterns, however faint. The genes that cause the suppression of color are stronger than the genes for any color including the mighty orange. So far i have trapped three cats, one female and two males, all solid black. The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one x chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other.</p>

They are not specifically bred to have orange spots, but sometimes when a litter of kittens are born genetics will play a role. We have an orange tabby male that is the most loving cat i’ve ever had (and throughout my life, i’ve had 8 cats).</p>

<p>Remember that blue is the dilute of black, and cream is the dilute of red. All cats are unique and awesome in their own way, but orange tabby cats have a special place in many peoples’ hearts. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, xx, and male cats have xy sex chromosomes. Approximately 20 percent of orange tabby cats are female. The motherly behavior is relative to the relationship between the females and the temperament of the cat.</p>

<p>I have actually only had my hands on one orange female, i have a deposit on her with a local rescue group. Males only have to inherit one orange gene to appear orange, while females have to inherit two. I adopted two male orange kittens, they are both with blue eyes, but the other one is with a clean deep blue eyes, and that cat turned out to be a female. In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. But both drool when they are purring.</p>

<p>If the cat is a female and not spayed, she can have kittens. They are not specifically bred to have orange spots, but sometimes when a litter of kittens are born genetics will play a role. While they aren�t very common, there are female orange cats. 2 males and 1 female, lazy you say, not a chance here. I think they are including orange and white as well.</p>
