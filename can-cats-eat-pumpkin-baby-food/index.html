<p>Your veterinarian can advise the specific quantity of pumpkin to serve, depending on your cat’s condition. It’s low in calories and high in fiber. I also add a little potassium chloride. When my cat was sick she wouldn’t eat or drink. Babies and cats are both tiny creatures known for their delicate stomachs, so it makes sense that some types of baby food would be perfect for cats.</p>

<p>Additionally, we want to mention that constipation and dehydration often go hand in hand. Can my cat eat chocolate? When my cat was sick she wouldn’t eat or drink. During the day they have some fiber bread. Pumpkins left outside as a decoration are often eaten up by squirrels, deer, and other outdoor animals.</p>
