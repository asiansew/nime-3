<p>In cold temperatures, your cat will feel much colder than we do therefore, we need to take some action to help kitty get some warmth. In this article you’re going to learn if it is okay to leave cats outside in winter.

Rain, not just snow, can cause illness and hypothermia. Your cat�s fur coat only really works when it�s dry.</p>

<p>Your cat�s fur coat only really works when it�s dry. If you let them in and they go to a warm place in your home, then you know it will be because it was too cold for them outside. Once you’ve blocked the rain, snow, and cold air from getting to the cat, as well as how to provide warmth during the night, cat lovers can ensure that their favorite stray is warm all winter long. Older cats over 7 years old have weakened immune systems. Cats trying to shelter from the cold often crawl into car engines where there is some warmth left over from when the car was last driven, so check underneath before you drive off.</p>
