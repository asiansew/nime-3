<p>Your cat may just be sleeping in odd positions that leads to temporary snoring. Cats snore when the passages in the upper airways, so in the nose, throat or back of the mouth (pharynx) vibrate audibly while breathing. Your cat may just be sleeping in odd positions that leads to temporary snoring. This may happen once in a while, as opposed to every time your pet goes to sleep, and it is considered normal. Brachycephalic cat breeds snore more than other cats.</p>

<p>Cats with short noses, including himalayan and persian, are more prone to snoring than other breeds. Sometimes, cats make snoring noises when they are awake. Yep, that’s snoring you hear. This is the time when they are resting and staying alert simultaneously. Their shortened nasal passages and elongated soft palates can lead to noisy sleeping.</p>

<p>Lately it has been making sounds while sleeping,that my logic says it�s snorring. When your cat falls into a deep sleep and becomes completely relaxed, she might start snoring. Cats can sleep in the most unbelievable positions due to how flexible they are and sometimes these awkward positions can cause your cat to snore. In terms of cats, the study found that as many as 7% of cats who slept in the same room as their owners were guilty of snoring. It�s common for cats to nap, but only fall into a light sleep.</p>
