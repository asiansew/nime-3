<p>Chicken breast, zucchini, carrot, calabrian chilis, parmesan. Many of our ingredients are locally sourced or grown here at the restaurant.

Fat cats features down home dishes like a fried chicken sandwich and more distinguished ones such as arroz caldo, a filipino dish made with rice, ginger, garlic and poached egg.</p>
