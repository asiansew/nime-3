<p>If you don’t see an animal that meets your needs, please check back regularly as we are always getting in more cats looking for loving forever homes. These cats would not be content as house pets but would thrive in a barn, horse stable, warehouse, garage, garden shed or other appropriate indoor/outdoor location. Placing them as barn cats on rural property is a humane, practical alternative to euthanasia. The $25 adoption fee for barn cats helps us cover some of their medical costs. Find a new cat we sometimes have barn/working cats awaiting adoption at our springfield location.</p>

<p>If you have a working barn or safe, heated outbuilding, there are cats who need you. (a municipal pet license may be required) if you are interested in adopting a barn cat, or have questions, contact <a href="mailto:backyardbuddies@thehumanesociety.org">backyardbuddies@thehumanesociety.org</a>. Since many of these cats thrive in each other�s company, we offer an adoption fee of $75 when you adopt two barn/working cats together. Barn cats discourage rodents, provide companionship for horses and other farm animals, and can live out their lives in relative security and comfort. These cats are available for adoption at larimer humane society.</p>

<p>These cats would not be content as house pets but would thrive in a barn, horse stable, warehouse, garage, garden shed or other appropriate indoor/outdoor location. Others are friendly, but are too unhappy living indoors to be good house pets. The cats often develop strong bonds with other cats, which is why the wisconsin humane society recommends that at least two cats be placed together. Our working cat program is designed to find homes at barns, warehouses, farms and other safe locations for cats that have traditionally been. They are perfectly content chasing mice or hanging out in a barn…</p>
