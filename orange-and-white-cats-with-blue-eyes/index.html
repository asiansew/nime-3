<p>The higher the level of refraction the cat has in their eyes, the deeper the shade of blue will appear. These are the possible colors for cat’s eyes they don’t call any color orange all thoe there are some that ceritnely look orange. The higher the level of refraction the cat has in their eyes, the deeper the shade of blue will appear. I�ve seen them in japanese bobtails. Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes.</p>

<p>A pack of dog had threded her. The spectrum of the color they can have ranges from green, hazel, golden yellow, lemon yellow, amber, orange, copper and even mixed colors. Many have bronze eyes like topaz stones. I adopted two male orange kittens, they are both with blue eyes, but the other one is with a clean deep blue eyes, and that cat turned out to be a female. The balinese has a silky, flowing coat and gorgeously deep blue eyes.</p>

<p>Black cats come with many of the colors on the chart. In some cases a completely white cat will have a gene with white spots resulting in “odd eyes” (one blue and the other gold or green). Then i googled if it was rare, and they say both parent have to be red so there would could be a red orange female, but her parents were orange (father) and dark grey. Russian blues always have green eyes where siamese cats always have blue eyes. Certain breeds usually have specific colors of eyes.</p>
