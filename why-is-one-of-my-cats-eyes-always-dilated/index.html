<p>Its the lense at the front of the eye. A head injury, stroke or brain tumor can affect how your pupils react to light and cause dilated pupils. The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light. My other cats are neutered just not him yet) Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right.</p>

<p>Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right. They will get smaller with light but the pupils are twice as big as my other cats. Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right. When frisky is very playful or feeling stressed, her pupils can become very large to reflect her feelings. My cat angel�s pupils are always dilated, whether she�s around light or in the dark.</p>

<p>Also, her eyes seem to reflect different colors. When frisky is very playful or feeling stressed, her pupils can become very large to reflect her feelings. Glaucoma is another common cause for differing pupil size in cats. The pupils will usually contract very quickly so that they are little more than slits. One of my cats has always had giant pupils, in all kinds of light.</p>
