The usually solitary stems of milkweed grow 1 to 5 feet tall and bear opposite (sometimes whorled), sometimes fleshy leaves with entire margins. He and his sister belleflower adore each other and do everything together.</p>

<p>The winner is the asclepias incarnata, common name: Here are some facts about this amazing plant: The mother lays her eggs directly on the milkweed, on the underside of the leaf. The cats like the butternut squash and cucumbers. Cat still eating the dill.</p>

<p>Looked just like the photos on the web. Milkweed species in the genus asclepias contain cardiac glycosides that are poisonous to humans, but they pose the most danger to grazing animals. The it i am referring to is, of course, milkweed …the lifeblood of monarchs!. Swamp milkweed (asclepias incarnata) is another popular type for wet areas. As with common milkweed, showy milkweed can become very invasive in the garden.</p>

<p>This would explain why monarchs need to use a combination of senses to find milkweed. If one of them sleeps with their foster mom, the other one is right there in bed with her too. As with common milkweed, showy milkweed can become very invasive in the garden. I do leave them alone, but am wondering.i have had a total of 23 cats so far this summer, and only one that i found inmy patio area where my milkweed is made a chrystallis and it has been 16 days and doesn�t look like she is alive. This would explain why monarchs need to use a combination of senses to find milkweed.</p>
