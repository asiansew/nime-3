<p>The early ancestor of the sand cat, a few thousand years ago, was the european wildcat. A cat has no collarbone, so it can fit through any opening the size of its head. Sand cats are a pale tan or sandy color (to match all the sand of course), with some dark spots or stripes on their fur. The visible part of the cat’s ear is extremely large, which helps protect the ear from the sand. How long your cat lives largely depends on his environment.</p>
