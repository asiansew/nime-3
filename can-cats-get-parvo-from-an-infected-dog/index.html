Parvo is extremely hardy and can survive on areas infected with feces indoors for at least a month and outdoors for up to a year under the right conditions. So, no, dogs can’t spread parvo to cats.</p>

<p>Canine parvovirus can be found anywhere and everywhere, from contact with other dogs to the hands or shoes of people who have handled contaminated dogs. That’s because canine parvovirus types 2a and 2b are similar to the feline parvovirus. Dogs and puppies get parvo when they are exposed to the virus either through contact with an infected dog or surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Parvo is extremely hardy and can survive on areas infected with feces indoors for at least a month and outdoors for up to a year under the right conditions. Pet dogs and cats can get infected with other parvoviruses that do not infect humans.</p>
