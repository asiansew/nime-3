<p>Cats can have chromosomal imbalances and should be screened by a vet. People with down syndrome have an extra chromosome that impacts how a person looks and their ability to think, learn, and reason. Cats only have 19 chromosomes, meaning they can’t technically have down syndrome. Cats can also experience these and many other abnormalities. Dogs have a larger chromosomal number, so they can experience mutations in this pairing.</p>

<p>Can cats can get down syndrome is a commonly asked question online, this is a result of some cats looking and behaving slightly differently from what you may expect. Cats only have 19 chromosomes, meaning they can’t technically have down syndrome. The injury may be sudden and the result of a trauma such as a car accident or other major impact or after landing from a jump from an extended height, or it may be due to repetitive use of the joint causing minor ligament damage over time that has a cumulative effect. Cats with wobbly or weak hind legs will have trouble walking, climbing and jumping. As such, it�s physically impossible for cats to have a trisomy of the chromosome 21 pairing.</p>
