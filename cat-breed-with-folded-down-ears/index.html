<p>Different cat registries have named the folded ear cat differently. In 1986 there was a report of a hebridean cat. Starting with his small ears folded down, which constitute the distinctive feature of the race. The scottish folds, the american curls, the highlander cats, and the ukrainian levkoy. They are also relatively rare and normally prospective owners have to wait to get a kitten.</p>

<p>There are 4 cat breeds that do have folded ears: All scottish fold cats can trace their lineage back to susie, the first cat known to have folded ears. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in scotland�s tayside. In 1986 there was a report of a hebridean cat. Instead, he could have the pick of susie’s first litter.</p>

<p>If you are interesting in scottish fold cats and are planning of getting one, remember these straight eared cats have just the same sweet character as the ones with folded ears. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in scotland�s tayside. Despite the folded ears, these cats can hear perfectly fine. Such was the case with the scottish fold. They can stay that way after the cat is back to it�s normal self, but that usually happens only if the ears weren�t �properly� folded in the first place.</p>

<p>These playful and sociable cats love the company of humans, so they won’t enjoy being left home alone all day. However, this is the result of a genetic condition that can cause them to have short and painful lives. Today, cat lovers who want to own a scottish fold might have to be put on a waiting list and pay several hundred dollars for a kitten. Often, the creation of a new cat breed hinges on a natural genetic mutation that occurs unexpectedly in an otherwise ordinary cat. They are very different cats, but they do share this characteristic.</p>
