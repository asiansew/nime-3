<p>The university of pennsylvania college of veterinary medicine points out feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is the most common form of cardiac disease in cats. Epiphora is a condition that causes an abnormal overflow of tears. Short faced, or brachycephalic cat breeds, are genetically predisposed to have short noses and bulging eyes. A small amount of crusting in the corner of the eyes is normal, but continual weeping or a sticky discharge is not. With conjunctivitis, your cat will squint more and have watery eyes, but the discharge from your cat�s eyes may be green, yellow, gray, dark, or rusty looking rather than clear.</p>

<p>When it comes to your cat eye discharge and other eye issues, don’t delay making that vet appointment — your cat’s eyes and eyesight might depend on it. In particular, you may find a cat wheezing while sleeping more often if they are one of these breeds. There are a number of things that can cause your cat’s eye to water. What causes runny eyes in cats? Your cat could also be suffering from a crustier build up near the eyes.</p>

<p>Tears can overflow due to inflammation, infection, or swelling that blocks the cat’s tear duct. I usually wipe her eyes after she eats. The upper or lower lid may be affected. Physical symptoms of a dying cat for specific diseases. While infection, irritation, allergies and other causes for watery eyes exist, one of the most common causes of watery eyes and tearing is, oddly, dry eyes.</p>
