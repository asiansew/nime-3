<p>The first thing we spotted was unresponsive pupils. So even in a bright room, the eyes stay dilated. I never see them with slits and they appear dull. When our older calico suddenly went to full black pupils in both eyes (a tiny sliver of color around the black, but as full as i’ve ever seen in a cat), i asked a vet online since it was late on. That can be a normal sign of aging, or it can be a sign of serious disease.</p>

<p>To moisten and lubricate the eyes. Pain also can be indicated either by a constricting or dilating of your cat�s pupils. You can test this by putting some obstacles in a corridor and watch to see if they bounce into things or their whiskers are pointing right forward all the time so they �feel� their way around using their whiskers.
