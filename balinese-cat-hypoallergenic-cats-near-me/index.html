Be prepared to match wits with this breed. If you contact a balinese breeder, be watchful for signs that the breeder is running a kitten mill. This cat will stick near you, but don’t get a siberian if you want a lap cat. A balinese is a siamese with a genetic mutation resulting in a luxurious, thick coat.</p>

<p>But it is one of the few breeds that produce less of the fel d1 protein than other cats, thus causing fewer allergic reactions in allergy sufferers. Forestwind siberians is a siberian cat breeder dedicated to ensuring your pet siberian is happy, healthy, and huggable, while we work to ensure the preservation of the aboriginal siberian cat. I would love the opportunity to introduce you to this exceptional breed and help you find your new best friend&amp;perio. This allergen becomes airborne once the cat licks its coat. These breeds include balinese, russian blue, bengal and devon rex.</p>

<p>I have loved siamese cats since i was a child&amp;period; Often referred to as the “longhaired siamese,” the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed. These breeds include balinese, russian blue, bengal and devon rex. I would love the opportunity to introduce you to this exceptional breed and help you find your new best friend&amp;perio. Essentially no, the balinese cat does not shed a lot, which may come as a surprise when you see their coat.</p>
