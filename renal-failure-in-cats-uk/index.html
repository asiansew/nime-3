<p>Whether or not you decide to euthanize your cat is always a personal decision. Cats who suffer from this renal disease can live longer and have zero uremic episodes if they are fed a diet with a formula that was especially created with the kidneys in mind. Cats are more prone to kidney disease than dogs because they have shorter ureters, and shorter and deeper renal tubules. Polycystic kidneys causes cysts on the kidneys (fluid filled balloons) which stops them working properly. You can treat kidney failure in cats to extend a cat’s life, but, unfortunately, a time will come when you have to let your cat go.</p>

<p>Crf is a progressive condition without a cure, therefore early diagnosis and supportive treatment are required to slow the. It has been estimated that around one in five cats over 15 years old has renal failure. However, it can also occur in healthy cats eating mainly dry food but not drinking much water. For cats with severe chronic kidney failure, daily subcutaneous fluids may be necessary to maintain adequate hydration. Acute kidney failure is when the problem appears suddenly and it can affect cats of all ages.</p>
