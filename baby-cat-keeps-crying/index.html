<p>If your cat is used to getting what they want from meowing, they are going to meow more, and louder, when it quits working. Over time, a cat’s digestive system can become sensitive to an ingredient (usually a protein) and actually mount an immune response against that ingredient. Determining why a certain cat cries often is something that owners can do with simple observation of the cat�s behavior. Thankfully, as your baby gets older, he�ll be better able to soothe himself and much of the crying will stop. I have heard moans, crying like a baby, ear splitting screams, trills and sounds like a purr and a meow toget.</p>

<p>I played babies crying before our daughter was born and introduced them when she came home. This cat heard a baby crying and did the most human thing possible. Kitties love outside for all of it�s sounds and smells and sights, birds chirping and bug chasing, lounging in the sun/grass. Determining why a certain cat cries often is something that owners can do with simple observation of the cat�s behavior. Or the screams you hear are another cat in heat.</p>

<p>Kitties love outside for all of it�s sounds and smells and sights, birds chirping and bug chasing, lounging in the sun/grass. This cat heard a baby crying and did the most human thing possible. By the sound of things on. The most obvious reason for cat crying at night is illness. Determining why a certain cat cries often is something that owners can do with simple observation of the cat�s behavior.</p>
