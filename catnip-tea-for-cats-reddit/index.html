<p>The use of catnip leaves and flowers in herbal teas was documented at least as early as 1735 in the general irish herbal. Catnip is known for its intoxicating effects in cats, but does it work the same way in humans?. Sometimes when life gets hard, we, as humans, have the option to puff a cigarette, drink some tea, or even have a relaxing beer. It does this through its scent. Like most cats, we love catnip, but we also like sniffing the catmint plant and watching the bees and butterflies as they circle around the purple flowers.</p>
