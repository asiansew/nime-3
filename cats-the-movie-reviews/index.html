<p>The film has earned an 18% on rotten tomatoes from 186 reviews and a dismal metacritic score of 32. Tom hooper manages to take an already bad idea (turning cats into a live action movie) and makes it even worse than you could possibly imagine. Jennifer hudson , playing the outcast grizabella, gives multiple touching performances of the famous memory. The film has been at the centre of much discussion, ever since the first trailer was released in the summer, thanks to the way in which hooper decided to depict the felines. A tribe of cats called the jellicles must decide yearly which one will ascend to the heaviside layer and come back to a new jellicle life.</p>
