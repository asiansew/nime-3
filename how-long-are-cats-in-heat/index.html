The age at which they go into heat depends on different factors such as the breed, their overall health, and the seasonal effects on your cats. When do cats go into heat? A cat can stay in heat for 7 to 10 days and this can repeat every few weeks until she mates. Cats usually have their first heat at about 5 ½ to 6 months of age.</p>

<p>Female cats who haven�t been spayed will go into heat in a cyclical fashion. Unlike dogs, cats can be in heat several times a year. This relies on the season changes, species, etc. However, this depends on the weather and how easy food is for the cat to come by. Cats can experience heat as young as 4 months old, although some can be late bloomers, experiencing their first dose of heat at 6 months old.</p>

Cat estrus begins as animals reach sexual maturity, usually at about six months of age, although some cats will go into heat as early as four months and others as late as 10 to 12 months. Felines, in particular, can reach sexual maturity around six months of age. A cat feels the heat symptoms for.</p>
