<p>A spayed cat will tend to eat a little more and be slightly less active. If she is in heat, get her spayed. These cats respond to petting, hugging and motion much like the real ones you know and love but don�t require any special care or feeding. You just have to work out what kind of attention they are seeking. While you may enjoy having occasional “conversations” with your cat, when they are meowing a lot it can be aggravating.</p>

<p>Cat in heat sounds are eerily loud and almost sound. Cat breeds that are naturally high energy may be prone to excess meowing. She didn’t come from a very good home (too many little kids, other cats bullying her, neglected, closed up in a small room most of the day, etc.) so she’s still somewhat anxious and of course, as a result, meows almost constantly.

For more information and examples of cat meows and what they mean, take a look at this animalwised video:</p>

<p>There is nothing to worry, especially for new cat owners who don’t know the reason for this special vocalization. If a cat meows at its food dish, it wants food. One of the main reasons that an adult cat meows much is because it is in heat. It could even be something serious that warrants your attention, so if your kitty is talking up a storm, you need to find out why. If your animal is not sterilized it can prove that this situation will tremendously upset it.</p>
