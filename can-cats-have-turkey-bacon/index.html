Cats can eat turkey bacon but only as a small snack because its processing is a similar way as the one from pork and hence it has a lot of salt and may have other additives. The reason for this is because turkey bacon is a leaner meat than pork. However, you�ll find many veterinary lists of dangerous foods are longer.</p>

<p>If you were wondering if it’s safe for your cat to eat turkey, the short answer is yes, it is, but turkey comes in a few forms, and some are not as healthy as others. These processed meats also only have a fraction of the nutritional value that fresh turkey has. In fact when i switched him to the turkey bacon he lost weight and has more energy and he will turn 10 on june 3 2015. Here are thanksgiving foods you shouldn�t feed your cats and dogs. The short answer is “yes and no.” turkey is not toxic to dogs.</p>

<p>All food should be cooked before offering to your cat to prevent any potential diseases that can derive from poorly cooked meats. Turkey bacon should also be fed to cats in very small doses due to the high amount of sodium and preservatives. Cats have trouble digesting the lactose in milk, which can cause an upset stomach or diarrhea. The short answer would be no, it’s not okay to. Unless you buy sausages from a pet store with a little salt and other preservatives.</p>
