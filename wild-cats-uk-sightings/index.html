<p>For more than 50 years, people have reported sightings of big cats in the british countryside. The beast is said to have been terrorising the streets in halifax, west yorkshire, leaving people mystified as to what the animal could be. Big cat fans claim some of the clearest pictures in britain have been taken of a wild puma. It became illegal in 1977 for people to keep big cats as pets after the dangerous and wild animals act was introduced. The wild cat (felis silvestris) is britain’s only wild member of the cat family and bears a close resemblance to the domestic tabby cat.</p>

<p>It became illegal in 1977 for people to keep big cats as pets after the dangerous and wild animals act was introduced. In british folklore, british big cats, also referred to as abcs (alien, or anomalous, big cats), phantom cats and mystery cats, are reports and incidents of felidae not native to britain but supposed to inhabit the british countryside. Big cat sightings are bizarrely a fairly regular occurrence in the uk and date as far back as 1962 when reports of the surrey puma first circulated. Sightings of big cats are not uncommon in the uk, although there is often a lack of hard evidence to confirm what people are seeing as an unusual phenomenon. The theory that britain has an elusive population of wild big cats has proved enduring, with many people reporting sightings in rural areas.</p>
