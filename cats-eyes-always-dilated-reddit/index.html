<p>It�s not unusual for the iris to change with age. Dilated eyes (actually the pupils) look like the eyes in the photo below. If the animal�s pupils didn�t line up when it was grazing, head down. My other cats are neutered just not him yet) Does my cat see — ghosts?</p>

<p>Each eye is a different color. The cat has dilated pupils and eyes wide open. There is pigment in the iris that causes the eye colour. This is an automated general reminder to please follow the sub rules when discussing this question:. Satisfactionin situations that produce happiness, the cat also dilates its pupils as a reflex.</p>

<p>The iris is the coloured part of the eye that changes shape to form a larger or smaller iris. When you get your eyes dilated, your doctor uses special drops to open your pupils wide. Though eye disease is less common in cats than dogs, you should rush to the vet as soon as you can if your cat’s eye or eyes appear cloudy. Cats with urinary infections will want to make a rapid trip to the litter box. If your cat has these symptoms, take him to a veterinarian.</p>
