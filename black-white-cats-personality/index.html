<p>Bicolor cats that are black and white are sometimes called magpies. At any age, they love to look at the world around them and their favorite place may often turn out to be a window where they can observe the world. The cream and white bicolor cat is the rarest of the bicolors, while the black and white or blue (grey) and white are the most common.
