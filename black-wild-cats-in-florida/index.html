<p>Click on the cat’s name in the table below to see further information on that species.; There has never ever been a black cougar or a florida panther ever found. The big black cats are black leopards or black jaguars and are not referred to as black panthers by anyone who knows anything about big cats. Mammals with this mutation are known as melanistic. The florida panther is the most endangered animal in north america, with a surviving population of about 150 in the wild.</p>

<p>The big black cats are black leopards or black jaguars and are not referred to as black panthers by anyone who knows anything about big cats. Up to 15 years range: White tail deer, cattle, armadillos, wild hogs, raccoons, even alligators can all be part of a typical jaguar�s diet. A man in florida was recently mauled by a captive black leopard, after he paid $150 to enter its cage. 2012, the wikipedia authors list 40 wild cats.</p>

<p>11 wild animals you�ll find in southwest florida from bobcats to otters, here�s a sampling of the wildlife you might run into in southwest florida. Florida is home to two predatory big cats: Because most melanistic wild cats were found in jungles with less light than other types of environments, it was believed that the melanism (dark coloring) was an inherited trait or condition that aided. But still we hear these stories of black cats that lurk in the wilds of florida, says hitzig. The only big cat found in florida is the florida panther, a sub subspecies of the cougar.</p>
