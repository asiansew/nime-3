<p>Cats need lots of protein and strawberries are severely lacking in this department. They need a lot of protein because they’re carnivores, but they can’t get any of this from strawberries. Strawberries are a scrumptious staple in lots of american kitchen areas, and also they’re loaded with nutrients like vitamin c, folate, potassium, manganese, nutritional fiber, and also magnesium.
