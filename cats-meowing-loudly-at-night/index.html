(in the wild, a sick animal is an easy target for predators.) however, cats might start meowing loudly or meow a lot more when something is not right medically. If your cat is verbalizing excessively after dark, something is wrong. And we love them to bits! Is your cat’s meowing keeping you up at night?</p>

<p>Before this becomes a major concern, determine the problem and look to resolve it. Loud, frequent meowing becomes more common as cats age. Some common reasons your cat is meowing throughout the night include: Just pretend nothing is happening. So if this is a new behaviour for your cat, or the cat is elderly, your vet can take a blood sample to test for any underlying conditions.</p>

<p>This could be due to changes in their environment, or perhaps if they�ve moved house. Conditions such as hyperthyroid can also cause a cat to meow during the night. Your cat’s meowing at night may have much to do with the fact that they are naturally more active at certain hours of the night. Cats also yowl—a sound similar to the meow but more drawn out and melodic. Xem cats meowing loudly at night | cats meowing loudly non stop !</p>
