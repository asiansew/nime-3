Inflammation of the pancreas (or pancreatitis) often progresses rapidly in cats, but can often be treated without any permanent damage to the organ. The scarring also affects the insulin and digestive enzyme production thus leading to diseases like liver disease, (ibd) and diabetes. I am betting it will, at the least, confirm ibd and pancreatitis. Pancreatitis in cats is frequently accompanied by concurrent disease in other organ systems.</p>

<p>When the pancreas becomes inflamed, the condition is called pancreatitis. The scarring also affects the insulin and digestive enzyme production thus leading to diseases like liver disease, (ibd) and diabetes. Pancreatitis is a very different disease in dogs than it is in cats. I am mostly worried about something else going on more sinister like lymphoma. That is why some cats can exhibit signs of digestive problems, others can show symptoms of diabetes (such as increased water consumption), and there are some that can show both types of symptoms.</p>

<p>Cats who have all three syndromes are said to have triaditis. The pancreas is an internal organ that lies by the stomach in a cat. When pancreatitis occurs in cats, it is often accompanied by inflammation of the liver and intestine. Pancreatitis can affect both dogs and cats. Symptoms of pancreatitis in cats.</p>
