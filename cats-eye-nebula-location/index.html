<p><strong>Cats Eye Nebula Location</strong>. The cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae in the sky while there are many images of this object, this rendition has captured the extremes of this difficult target. Messier 94 (m94), also known as cat’s eye galaxy or croc’s eye galaxy, is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation canes venatici.the cat’s eye galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 8.99 and lies at a distance of 16 million light years from earth. The cat�s eye nebula, ngc 6543, is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation draco, discovered by william herschel on february 15, 1786. By comparing images spanning 20 years or more we can watch the nearest of these gently expand without changing their shapes or brightness.</p>

<p>I had planned my star hop using my binoculars a couple of weeks ago and there was a fairly obvious point of light in just about the right place. It was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated by the english amateur astronomer william huggins, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. The cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae in the sky while there are many images of this object, this rendition has captured the extremes of this difficult target. The cat’s eye nebula was discovered by william herschel on february 15, 1786. One of the brightest objects of its type, its resemblance to a cat�s eye is due to a series of gas loops that have been ejected by the central star over the past 1,000 years or so.</p>
