He was extremely striking as well, that very bright orange color that some of the marmalade cats seem to have. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. Yes, there are female orange/red/ginger tabbys, but the chance of one being born is about 20% verifying the above statement, around 1/4 of orange cats are female.</p>

<p>It turns out ginger cats aren�t always male. He was a stray until i adopted him at 4 months old, and has always been the sweetest most loving cat, but he always seems to have random health issues. Many orange cats will have white legs and a white underbelly. In fact, there are 80 males to every 20 females. With so few females to choose from, there are always some cats mating and creating new litters.</p>

<p>We’ve always had cats, passing away from age 13 to 22 years old. We have many female orange tabby cats in my practice. This isn�t true, but there are more male red tabbies than female ones. Ginger genes work differently in cats compared to people, which makes female ginger cats a little harder to come by. According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names.</p>
