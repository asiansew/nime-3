<p>It�s been said that siamese cats are hypoallergenic but this isn�t really true. These cats shed very less as they have short hairs and you will love them as they will not shed much inside the house. If you’ve experienced allergies to pets and worry that a siamese could trigger a response, you should be ok. Due to the low production of the fel d1 protein, which is responsible for producing the allergen, that makes them a good choice for cat lovers who may face allergic reactions. Siamese cats release less of the fel d1 protein that causes allergic reactions in humans.</p>

<p>They may however cause fewer allergy problems than other cats because of their short, fine fur. “contrary to popular belief, it is not. They’re not totally hypoallergenic, but they come close. The russian blue/wild cat cross. You might think this means more trapped allergens, but balinese cats actually produce less fel d 1 than many other breeds.</p>
