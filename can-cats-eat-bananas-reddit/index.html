But after living with humans, they become more gourmet and can eat things like humans. That can make us wonder if dogs can eat bananas, and if they are good to treat our dogs with. Dog owners love treating their pets, especially if they have done something good that needs a reward.there are only a few foods that we carry around with us that have easy to dispose of the packaging, and healthy for us.</p>

<p>Dog owners love treating their pets, especially if they have done something good that needs a reward.there are only a few foods that we carry around with us that have easy to dispose of the packaging, and healthy for us. Typically, cats enjoy foods like fish, liver, and good ol’ cat food from. Cats are less likely to eat chocolates on their own as they cannot taste the sweetness. The cooked cereal will be a good option. Can your pet cats eat bananas?</p>
