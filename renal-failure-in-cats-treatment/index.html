Dietary therapy is the only therapeutic intervention proven to favorably alter the course of cat kidney failure. Treatment usually involves iv fluids and other medications that will help a cat regain her normal kidney function.</p>

<p>Older cats aren’t the only ones at risk. Kidney failure usually affects older cats, but younger felines afflicted with the condition may lose their teeth. We recommend that iris ckd stage 1 patients with persistent proteinuria (upc ≥ 0.5 for dogs or 0.4 for cats) are not only monitored and thoroughly investigated but also receive standard treatment for proteinuria as currently recommended for iris ckd stages 2 to 4. In these cases, renal failure may already have been present for years. Acute renal failure is reversible and treatable if noticed in time.</p>
