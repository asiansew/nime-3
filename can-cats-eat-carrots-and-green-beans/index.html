<p>These bright orange vegetables are an excellent source of supplemental nutrition for cats. Green beans are high in protein and low in fat. When you think your cat’s diet has been quite unhealthy for some time, just drop a few chopped and rinsed green beans into her food bowl. Can cats eat lettuce and carrots. When it comes to carrots, you do not have to worry about anything.</p>
