<p>Also, remove the stems and leaves. Strawberries are a great source of vitamin c, potassium and manganese, all of which play vital roles in supporting your pet’s immune system. The short answer is yes, dogs can eat strawberries. We’ll also ask how much they can eat and will hopefully put your mind at rest if they have slyly stolen a bite or two from your plate or the kitchen counter, as cats so often do. They are not harmful or toxic.</p>

<p>Bunnies can eat all types of uncooked berries. Strawberries are full of nutrients and can boost your cats immune system. In the interest of eating as healthfully as possible, many people are now seeking out locally or organically grown foods and carefully reading food labels. They have some sugars that can be harmful in larger quantities though. Strawberries are not toxic to your cat as per aspca guidelines.</p>

<p>Poisoning in cats is therefore generally rare. Veg like cucumber, squash, peas, and pumpkin are full of vitamins and minerals. Also, remove the stems and leaves. Strawberries are full of healthy nutrients that are good for dogs, but like any good thing, they are best enjoyed in moderation. Grapes and raisins are highly toxic to some dogs and should not be given as a treat.</p>
