<p>This is the classic cream or white body with dark brown tail, legs, ears and face. I adopted two male orange kittens, they are both with blue eyes, but the other one is with a clean deep blue eyes, and that cat turned out to be a female. Joplin janis and scott joplin (ragtime composer) koko taylor; A dark cat with this name would be really enjoyable.

<p>While pedigreed black cats have a tendency towards bold orange eyes and white cats tend to have blue eyes, there�s very little to connect coat color with eye color. Orange (certainly fits the bill for names for orange cats!) oren (the color orange in welsh) oscar; The current ruling dynasty of thailand can serve as a great siamese cat name. Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes. Siamese cats come in a variety of color points, of which the best known may be the seal point.</p>

<p>It’s a beautiful name that would suit perfectly. If you�re looking for naming ideas for your new orange cat, look no further. While pedigreed black cats have a tendency towards bold orange eyes and white cats tend to have blue eyes, there�s very little to connect coat color with eye color. Persian cats are known for having eye colors that span the gamut from green, blue, and copper hues. Because they don’t develop eye pigmentation until they’re about six weeks old, all kittens are actually born with blue eyes, but it is rare to have them as adult cats.</p>
