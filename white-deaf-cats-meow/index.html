<p>According to international cat care: The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: It is a myth that every white cat is deaf, or that white cats with blue eyes, green eyes, or one of each are always deaf. Cats can’t tell us that they’re hard of hearing, and they compensate well by paying more attention with their other senses. Cats are born deaf until the age of two weeks where they gain their sense of hearing.</p>

<p>I really wouldn�t worry about it. This is an issue made worse by selective breeding of our feline friends. How will i know if my cat is deaf? It is curious to note that that particular cat could have shown a wide range of colors. Deaf cats may purr and meow louder than their hearing counterparts.</p>

<p>Two blue eyes, completely deaf. My veterinarian said white cats are often deaf. If a cat has a white colored coat and blue iris, she is predisposed to hearing problems. A deaf cat�s meows are often much louder than those of a nondeaf cat as well because it doesn�t know it�s deaf and can�t control the volume of its voice. Deal with cats this can be actually pretty common.</p>
