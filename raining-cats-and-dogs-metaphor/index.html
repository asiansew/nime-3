<p>In fact, �raining cats and dogs� only makes sense figuratively and the explanations below that attempt to link the phrase to felines, canines and weather seem rather feeble. A) a comparison using the word �kind� b) a comparison using the words �like� or �as� c) a direct comparison between two things 3) it is raining cats and dogs is an example of? You could replace cats and dogs with “raining fur and goats”, or “raining plastic and usb leads”, they wouldn’t be any different. For instance, on saturn�s moon titan, it rains methane. raining cats and dogs literally means that small animals are falling out of the sky. Great sheets of rain are pouring down.</p>

<p>If you said, it�s raining so hard it�s as though cats and dogs were falling from the sky, that would not be a metaphor, but an analogy. Some other words related to raining, that you can use in your book: If you add ‘like’ it is then clear that it is in the form of a ‘simile’; Whether swift coined �raining cats and dogs� and whether he meant that to be a reference to the animals being washed through the streets in heavy weather is entirely speculative. All those descriptions of precipitation make a certain amount sense.</p>

<p>You could replace cats and dogs with “raining fur and goats”, or “raining plastic and usb leads”, they wouldn’t be any different. Instead, the phrase is an idiom,. A metaphor is a word or a phrase to refer to something that it isn�t, implying a similarity between the word or phrase used and the thing described, if the metaphor does an explicit comparison with the words like. Something that you say when it is raining…. Some think it originated in the 1500s, when roofs were commonly thatched.</p>
