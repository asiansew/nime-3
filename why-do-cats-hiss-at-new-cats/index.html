<p>Cats from the same household may also hiss at each other when they don’t feel like sharing food, water, toys, or a sleeping space, or when they are tired of playing. This sound will usually be paired with other cat body language signs such as bared teeth, flattened ears, an arched back and their fur will also stand on end (also known as piloerection). It’s more likely that your cat is upset because of the new cat entering the home and they are in a mood. According to cat behavior experts, cats learned to hiss from snakes.
