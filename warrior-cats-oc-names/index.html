<p>If your oc haven�t been reviewed and someone else�s has before yours plz alert me or one of my other authors that is trustable. Thunder, wind, shadow and river. We will be reviewing ocs and making name generators and more. Warrior cats are divided into clans, each with their own territories, skills and beliefs. What is your warrior cat name kit, mate, clan, position, and apprentice?</p>
