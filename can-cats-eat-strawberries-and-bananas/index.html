<p>Can my cat eat carrots? However, in moderation, strawberries can be a fun and healthy treat for your kitty that’s an interesting change of pace from their normal food. If you are hesitating to feed your cat strawberries, i am very pleased to say: Apples (without core) can also be given to them. To summarize the answer, in short, if your cat likes to eat some pieces of strawberries then it’s fine.</p>

<p>A few other recognizable edible plants include the christmas cactus, cornflower, marigold, gerber daisy, petunia, rose, sunflower, venus fly trap, and zinnia. So, if you were wondering “can cats eat bananas”, the answer is yes. Also, they are low in lactose. But even though this fruit is incredibly rich in fiber, magnesium, vitamin c, and potassium, it is best given as a rare treat to your cat. Banana is considered safe for them.</p>
