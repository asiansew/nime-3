<p>Hyperthyroidism can protect the kidneys in cats with chronic kidney disease (see below) and great care must be taken when treating a cat who has both hyperthyroidism and kidney disease (i know first hand because my cat died within two weeks of starting on hyperthyroid medication). While this procedure is generally recognized as safe, it does pose a threat to the nearby parathyroid gland. Many cats live long and happy lives with medication to keep hyperthyroidism under control but regular visits to the vet and monitoring tests are often necessary. In affected cats, a wide variety of signs usually develop, but these are usually subtle at first, and become more severe over time as the underlying disease gets worse. There are pros and cons to using medication for cats with hyperthyroidism.</p>
