<p>Fresh pumpkin that has been baked until soft. Feed even more sparingly than the fresh pumpkin, an eighth of a teaspoon is more than enough. Cats can eat raw, boiled, or roasted pumpkin seeds. According to some veterinarians, pumpkin seeds are high in essential fatty acids and antioxidants (good for overall healthy skin and fur), and the oils in pumpkin flesh and seeds are believed to support urinary health. The answer to the question that cats can eat pumpkin is yes.</p>

<p>Even though cats are obligate carnivores, some fiber in the diet is good for keeping things moving. veterinarians recommend increasing fiber to help a cat who�s suffering from diarrhea or constipation. However, it is recommended that you clean and roast the pumpkin seeds for about an hour, and at a temperature of 350 degrees fahrenheit. Both pumpkin flesh and seeds are believed to benefit urinary health in cats and dogs. Even though feeding pumpkin to a cat has minimal risks, we advise that you talk with the vet prior to making any dietary changes. Feed even more sparingly than the fresh pumpkin, an eighth of a teaspoon is more than enough.</p>
