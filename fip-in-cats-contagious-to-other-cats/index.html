<p>The disease has a global distribution, and only affects cats: Cats are in a higher risk category (e.g., younger cats, colony cats, etc.) Fip is caused by the mutation of the corona virus, which is highly contagious, as in passed through the litter box, food/water bowls, etc etc. It is important to note that while fecv is quite contagious (it is passed in the feces and saliva of infected cats and infects other cats primarily via the oral cavity), fipv is not believed to be. Although the i in fip stands for infectious, the syndrome usually does not spread from one cat to another.</p>

<p>If you have your other cats antibody tested, you may find that they have higher antibody titres than the one which developed fip, but that does not mean that they will develop fip. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) in cats is a viral disease and often proved to be fatal in households and wild cats. The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus. Learn more about the causes and treatment of fip here. Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other.</p>
