<p>Garlic belongs to the plant family of allium, a plant group with a characteristic aroma and is mostly bulbous herbs. Onions are a part of the allium species of plants, which also includes garlic, chives, shallots, leeks, and scallions. Garlic is certainly not good for a cat. The smells of onions and garlic are not too pleasant for people as well. An onion can become toxic to a feline if more than 1 gram per 5 pounds of body weight is ingested.</p>

<p>But cats, and even dogs, don’t have that ability. That can also be toxic to cats. An onion can become toxic to a feline if more than 1 gram per 5 pounds of body weight is ingested. Although numerous cat owners assume garlic to be poisonous to cats, some are still trying the oral treatment. In fact, it isn’t only onion that’s toxic to cats.</p>

<p>Also cats do not like the smells of onion and garlic. Also cats do not like the smells of onion and garlic. Since garlic is more concentrated than an onion, an even smaller ingested amount could lead to toxicosis—as little as one clove of garlic can lead to toxicity in cats and small dogs. I would have to take him to the vet two or three times a year for expensive creams that took quite a while to work.one day i read an article about using garlic to treat skin conditions in cats.i took the garlic and minced it and put it in a container with a bit of olive oil.i rubbed it all over the infected areas and within a week or two i. Garlic, onions, and chives are all in the same group—and all are toxic to dogs and cats.</p>
