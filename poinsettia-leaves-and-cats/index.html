<p>While it is commonly touted as a toxic plant, poinsettias are only mildly toxic to dogs and cats. Poinsettia plants are less toxic than once believed. When christmas or english holly is ingested, it can result in severe gastrointestinal upset thanks to the spiny leaves and the potentially toxic substances (including saponins, methylxanthines, and cyanogens). However, they only cause mild symptoms and do not pose a great danger to cats. The milky white sap on the leaves actually tastes bitter and irritating to your cat:</p>

<p>Cats and ponsettias at a glance. While eating poinsettias can cause mild stomach upset in dogs and cats, other poisonous holiday plants like mistletoe, holly, amaryllis, and lilies can cause much worse health effects like low. Tulip bulbs are toxic for dogs and cats, though cut tulips seem to be ok. The truth is, a kid would have to eat about 500 poinsettia leaves to get sick. As for cats, it can be a little harmful, but not fatal.</p>

<p>That�s not to say they�re. Cat owners should know that carnations are toxic to cats, dogs and horses. I looked it up and google told me that poinsettias are “mildly toxic”. A mild stomachache, vomiting or diarrhea. It is still a good idea to keep pets from ingesting the leaves of the poinsettia.</p>

<p>The poinsettia (/ p ɔɪ n ˈ s ɛ t i ə / or / p ɔɪ n ˈ s ɛ t ə /) (euphorbia pulcherrima) is a commercially important plant species of the diverse spurge family (euphorbiaceae).indigenous to mexico and central america, europeans described it in 1834. If ingested, most cats lip smack, drool, and head shake excessively due to the mechanical injury from the spiny leaves. Since then, poinsettia plants have a earned a bad reputation and are considered as extremely poisonous. I never had a cat until 6 months ago. If you caught your cat in the act of eating any part of a poinsettia, let your vet know too.</p>
