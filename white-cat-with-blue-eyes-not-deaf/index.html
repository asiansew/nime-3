Deafness can also be caused by illness or injury, so a person adopting a deaf cat may not know whether the cat was born that way or became deaf later on. White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. 40% chance of hearing loss if a cat has only one blue eye.</p>

<p>Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Nevertheless, if she does not adopt her genetic color even after months of her birth, you should consult your vet. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear. The roll of the genetic dice that produces a white. Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness.</p>

<p>My veterinarian said white cats are often deaf. Probably 1 in 10 that your new kitten will not be deaf. But this blindness is not common in the rarest creature; In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. The roll of the genetic dice that produces a white.</p>
