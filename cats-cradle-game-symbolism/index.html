<p>The ancient children�s game is a sham. Some characters lie to themselves for happiness, like a child pretending to see the cat and the cradle because they enjoy the game.

<p>Cat�s cradle is a novel by kurt vonnegut that was first published in 1963. Newt’s painting was a representation of the cat’s cradle and should not be confused as the actual cat’s cradle.
