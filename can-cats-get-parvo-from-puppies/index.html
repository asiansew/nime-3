<p>How do dogs get parvo? People who handle an infected cat or an infected cat�s bedding, food, or water dish can carry the virus to the next cat they handle. Both kittens and puppies also can receive important antibodies from their mothers while nursing. However, there are some studies that have shown that a mutated strain of the canine parvovirus (cpv) can, in fact, infect cats. Whether dogs can get parvo from other animals is an important question considering the fact that dogs may be exposed to other animals or wild life even when they are considered safe in their yards.</p>

There is some debate over whether cats can get parvo from dogs, but the majority opinion seems to be no. Some dog owners have coughed up to $2000 for recurring treatments. Parvo is preventable with vaccination, but being aware of the risks of the virus can help keep your dog protected. The parvovirus in dogs is also very closely associated with the herpes virus panleukopenia:</p>
