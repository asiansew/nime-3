<p>Cats cannot eat oranges including the mandarin, orange juice or any other citrus fruit including lemon, limes, grapefruits, citron, tangerine, pomelo, tangelo, and so on. If your cat would consume some orange, then she would most likely get a bad diarrhea and/or start to vomit. Furthermore, these pets will not even love them when offered because they have a strong scent which seems not to go down well with them. Lemons, oranges and limes are all unhealthy for cats, as are the fruit, peelings and seeds of grapefruit. Make sure to peel the skin and remove the stem, core, and seeds, which can be toxic to your cat.</p>

This is because the crucial oil and psoralens that oranges contain are toxic, especially to cats.</p>
