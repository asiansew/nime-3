<p>Cats can adapt well to cold weather but if it goes below freezing then you’re asking for trouble. This will not be enough to place a cat in any danger, though. So keep reading to find out more about cats and the cold. The fact is that the cold virus that humans get is not susceptible to the common felines that gift us with their presence in our lives. In colder climates, they may also need the help of human caretakers to survive to spring.</p>

<p>Big cats have evolved by growing thicker coats, and they continue to hunt and eat all through winter. On the inside, there’s a partition if you want to give each cat it’s own separate quarters. This will enable the cat to maintain optimum body temperature. Cats can catch frostbites or hypothermia which can be dangerous to your cats health. If the weather is bitter cold or snowing keep your pets inside.</p>

<p>Nature naturally prepares a cat�s coat to become thicker and denser to fight off the cold, however, a thick coat doesn�t always mean a whole lotta warmth. With a little effort you can give a feral or stray cat a chance to survive the winter. Here are some ways to make sure your cats remain comfortable throughout winter. Feral cats are also more likely to injure humans who try to handle them. It can’t get at our cats but perhaps one of them doesn’t believe that.</p>
