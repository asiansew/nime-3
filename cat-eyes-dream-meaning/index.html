<p>You will have some failures soon. They see a good friend, partner or family member in you and the cat in your dream actually represents those people and their needs that they want you to. Maybe it indicates seeing something good in a negative situation. You have the ability to see what an ordinary person cannot see, so it represents an advantage over an eventual confrontation. It can also indicate being efficient.</p>

<p>An example of an balanced illusion is fantasizing about marrying someone you have a crush on, but hardly know. Dreaming about cats could meaning anything from intuition, femininity, misfortune, to bad luck. Everything you start in the next few days or months is going to turn into a disaster, so it is probably for the best to lay low for a while. If you dreamed that the green eyes of the cat are turning red, then this is a warning: You can interpret such dreams by associating the context of the dream with the cat itself.</p>

<p>The activity associated with the cat you see in your dream is important to its meaning. If you dream that your beloved one looks at you with those eyes, it means that he loves you and values your relationship. For example, a black cat does not necessarily mean that something good or bad is coming your way, but it could serve more as a guiding sign. Other interpretations claim that cats in dreams symbolize femininity, softness, an independent spirit, creativity, power, misfortune, vulnerability, bad luck, deceit and falseness (see what i mean about multiple supposed meanings?). A dream where you see cat eyes is symbolic of being in a position to solve problems and difficulties that come into your life.</p>
