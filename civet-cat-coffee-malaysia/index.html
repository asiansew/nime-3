<p>Civet cat droppings are found in random places, littered around my liberica�s sprawling coffee plantation. During a day spent hiking through the rice terraces around beautiful ubud, bali, we stopped in at a spice farm that was selling this famous beverage. Civet cat droppings are found in random places, littered around my liberica�s sprawling coffee plantation. Produced in java &amp; sumatra, and roasted in malaysia; After swallowing the coffee berries, the cat digests the flesh and pass out the coffee seeds with the excrement.</p>

<p>The coffee was produced within the natural ecosystem between the civet cats and the plantations. Following digestion and passage through the civet cats, the beans are collected from the forest floor. The malayan civet (viverra tangalunga), also known as the malay civet and oriental civet, is a viverrid native to the malay peninsula and the islands of sumatra, bangka, borneo, the riau archipelago, and the philippines.it is listed as least concern by iucn as it is a relatively widely distributed, appears to be tolerant of degraded habitats, and occurs in a number of protected areas. Drinking poop coffee sounds terrible, but kopi luwak is one of the most exclusive coffees in the world. Didn�t drink yet due to my silly mistake dropping glass part of french press :cry:</p>

<p>Kopi luwak is the world’s most expensive coffee.the main factor of it’s high price is the uncommon method of producing such a coffee. Our civet coffee is the age bean that keeps for more than 3 years. Unfortunately, most producers of this type of coffee keep the small animals, which we affectingly know as toddy cats, locked up in cages. In addition to indonesia, kopi luwak is produced in the philippines, thailand, and vietnam. Fri 23 may 2003 21.47 edt.</p>

<p>Drink civet coffee in the morning and you will have the booster of a good day. More and more farmers are chopping their coffee trees with exactly the same reasons given by my neighbor. Imagine a cat crossed with a monkey with grabby hands on energy drinks all the time. Most of the species diversity is found in southeast asia. To sum up, civet coffee can be a very good choice for your drink option.</p>
