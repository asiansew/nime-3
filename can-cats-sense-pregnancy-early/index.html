Pets probably can sense pregnancy. Stick to your regular routine for as long as you can to avoid your cat developing behavioral problems. Pregnancy, your dog, and that sixth sense while there is no scientific proof that explains precisely why dogs, or any other animal for that matter, can pick up on pregnancy, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>Of course they�re not people (technically), but your feline or canine companions are especially equipped to sense things like this. In fact, cats sense pregnancy before you know it yourself. A female cat can get pregnant when they are as young as 4 months old, unless they have been spayed to prevent that. Animals do have a higher sense of awareness than most humans do, so i�d say yes. Cats have almost as good a sense of smell as dogs do.</p>

<p>Pets probably can sense pregnancy. Hormonal changes during pregnancy may make you smell differently. Cats live in a world of scent, which we humans can never fully understand, and it is likely they can sense when their owner is pregnant fairly early on. Sorta like a gentle velcro thing. Cats and dogs are believed to have a sixth sense that enables them to sense and anticipate certain important events way before they are to occur.</p>

<p>I have two cats that normally get on, but with both my pregnancies they constantly used to fight each other for my attention! If a woman has already been infected by the parasite in the past, being exposed to it again during pregnancy will not be a problem. This is why it’s important to keep an eye on how your cat is behaving if you’re looking to conceive. A female cat can get pregnant when they are as young as 4 months old, unless they have been spayed to prevent that. Pets probably can sense pregnancy.</p>
