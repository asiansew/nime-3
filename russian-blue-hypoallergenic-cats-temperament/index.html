<p>They were first shown in 1875 in london, competing with other blue cats. They cannot pull their tail or annoy them. I have over 20 years breeding experience and take great pride in all my babies. Their nose leather and paw pads are soft and lilac in colour. This cat breed produces less fel d 1 glycoprotein, a secretoglobin protein that is produced in a cat’s sebaceous glands and saliva and is the primary allergen in cats and kittens.</p>

<p>The precise origins of the breed are unknown, but many believe these cats hail from russia based on their warm double coat. While she has a tendency to attach to one pet parent in particular, she demonstrates affection with her whole family and demands it in return. The russian blues are intelligent cats, elegant, quiet somewhat shy with strangers but at the same time they are lovers of games. In fact, this breed is known for their flawless grace.

<p>Russian blue cats often have very strong links with their family and especially with one particular member. In the 1900s, the first russian blue cats arrived the united states of america. In 1871 a russian blue was shown at the first cat show at the crystal palace in london, under the name archangel cat. You can trust the russian blue cat totally and it will rarely let you down. They love to run, jump, climb, climb the highest places in the house where you can watch carefully and also have fun with both humans and other pets.</p>
