<p>Sometimes it may indicate an eye problem that needs veterinary attention. The last few days i have noticed he is spending more time on the bed rather than playing, though he does play in the morning. If your cats eyes water then read this so you know what to do. This is one of the most commonly prescribed supplements in shelter medicine and works well for cats with eye issues related to the feline herpes virus. Sneezing and watery eyes are 2 symptoms that are frequently met in cats suffering from allergic reactions.</p>

<p>Eye discharge in cats can show itself in a few different common ways. First, there can be the presence of a watery discharge coming from your cat’s eyes. Watery eyes, just like in humans, can mean that the eye is dry, which is easily resolved with eye drops. Make sure to clean their house (if any), and help them to avoid things that can make them sneeze, such as dirty rugs, pest spray molecules, or even their litter box. Pollens, dust mites and chemicals.</p>

<p>Like humans, cats can also suffer from allergic reactions. Also, like humans, cats suffer from allergies to common things such as grass, pollen, fabrics and cigarette smoke, which can cause their eyes to water. Other common causes of leaky, watery eyes in cats include allergies, injuries, parasites, and fungal diseases. Cats generally don�t like things getting too close to their eyes and if they feel something actually touching their eyeball, they�re going to object to it. I always worry and wonder if i need to be concerned.</p>
