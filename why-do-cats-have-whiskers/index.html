The primary function of whiskers is to aid with vision, especially in the dark, by providing additional sensory information — much like antennae on other creatures. It helps the cat detect changes in the surroundings. Vet info says that most cats have 12 long whiskers on either side of their nose. The word ‘whisker’ itself arises from a latin word ‘vibrio’ meaning ‘vibrate’.</p>

<p>Whiskers are also known as “vibrissae” and their main purpose is to allow a cat to navigate their surroundings, especially in the dark. When they shed body hair, they also sometimes shed a few whiskers at the same time. Just like the other body hair, if a cats lose whiskers accompanied by the other symptoms such as watery eyes and bad breadth, it could indicate vitamin deficiency, and in such a case she should be taken to a veteran for proper treatment. Another reason why cats have whiskers is because they are so useful for this animal in terms of their movement and location, it is not surprising that they also use them to express their mood or feelings. If they are curious or are on the hunt, they’ll press them slightly forward.</p>

<p>These whiskers grow on the back of the leg, near the fifth toe of the foot. Whiskers are also known as “vibrissae” and their main purpose is to allow a cat to navigate their surroundings, especially in the dark. Cats have shorter ones near their eyebrow area, on the jawline, and on the back of their front legs. If you’ve never noticed them before, take a look at your cat right now. Whiskers are an important part of what makes cats so cute.</p>
