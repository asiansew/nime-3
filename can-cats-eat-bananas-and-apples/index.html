The short answer would be yes, it�s safe for cats to eat these fruits in small, controlled amounts. Apples won’t hurt your cat, as long as you don’t feed them the parts that contain cyanide. 10.4 can pet cats consume.</p>

<p>Fruits like apples can indeed be fed to cats however there are a few restrictions involved. Although bananas are high in protein, fiber, and vitamins, they are also high in natural sugars which can lead to obesity and diabetes. So if your cat really wants a small piece of that banana you�ve been eating, it�s fine. If i�m eating one she�ll come running from wherever in the house she was and start begging for some. Cats can eat the flesh of the avocado but make sure you only feed her the flesh and nothing else.</p>
