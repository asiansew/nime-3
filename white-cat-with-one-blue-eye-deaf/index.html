<p>A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes. Well, opinions vary, and so do research conclusions. However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies. The selkirk rex is a cat breed from the united states, 1988.</p>

<p>Epistatic gene, commonly referred to as dominant white, is the gene that produces white cats with blue, orange or odd color eyes and this mutation is most closely related to deafness. Strangely, blue eye white cats tend to be deaf even more than others. This cat is characterized by its curly hair, which is the product of a genetic mutation. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. Photography by belinda pretorius / shutterstock.</p>

<p>Of course, a potential owner will want to know the chances of her white cat being deaf. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. White spotted cats are rarely deaf and the once that are are mostly high grade white but i guess low grade white spotting can cause deafness id the white spotting runs over the ear. The w gene responsible for white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and presence of a blue eye can indicate the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. Epistatic gene, commonly referred to as dominant white, is the gene that produces white cats with blue, orange or odd color eyes and this mutation is most closely related to deafness.</p>
