<p>A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. In addition, longhaired white cats are 3 times more likely to be bilaterally deaf. Reports of this condition date back to at least the 1930s (bamber, 1933), and many investigators have studied it in. A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. Albino cats are prone to eyesight issues, but aren�t prone to deafness.</p>

A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. 25% of white cats with yellow eyes have normal hearing.</p>

<p>Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss. Their long, silky coats and big, expressive eyes look super elegant. Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate.</p>
