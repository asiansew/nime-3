<p>You might find that in the end, you’re still a dog person. The film has been at the centre of much discussion, ever since the first trailer was released in the summer, thanks to the way in which hooper decided to depict the felines. Full review | original score: If, like millions of americans, you are planning on seeing a movie over the holidays, the new reviews for the cats movie will either strike it from your list or have you stocking up your liquor. Tom hooper manages to take an already bad idea (turning cats into a live action movie) and makes it even worse than you could possibly imagine.</p>

<p>From the first shot — of just such a blue moon. Jennifer hudson , playing the outcast grizabella, gives multiple touching performances of the famous memory. The film has earned an 18% on rotten tomatoes from 186 reviews and a dismal metacritic score of 32. Ts eliot would not have minded cats reviews, says his estate. Cats may very well be the most unique film of the year, certainly released by a major studio, and you�ll love it and hate it but you sure won�t forget it.</p>

<p>Movie musical is a total disaster — johnny oleksinski, new york post. It’s more a pebble in the viewer’s shoe, gradually irritating as the movie blunders along. The story follows a tribe of cats called the jellicles over the course of one night as they prepare to present themselves to old. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible. Eliot’s “old possum’s book of practical cats” for the stage.</p>
