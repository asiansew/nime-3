<p>Unlike us, humans, who can create suction in order to get the liquid into our mouths, cats can’t do that so they use fluid mechanics to drink water in an efficient way. Stick with water 24/7 though! It even encourages them to drink more and keeps them entertained at the same time. Do cats like milk they actually need it alternatives and care what do cats drink is milk bad for purina Many cats like milk because in some ways it reminds them of their mother�s milk.</p>

<p>The two things are not really related. Kittens might like to have it on the warmer side because they associate it with their mothers milk but they might not be like other kittens and want it colder. Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they like it. You can offer small amounts as a treat.</p>

<p>Some cats don’t like water that is sitting in a bowl. Do cats like water or milk. You may have heard that cats don’t like water. You can offer small amounts as a treat. Even though your cat is grown, she may still crave milk.</p>
