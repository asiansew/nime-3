If you cat goes out on a screened patio or even visits a vet, she can pick up a disease there but of course these methods are less risky than for outdoor kitties. Cats can be vaccinated against all three of these diseases at once with the fvrcp combination vaccine. Fvrcp is a core vaccine and very strongly recommended for indoor cats, as these diseases are airborne, and so an indoor cat may catch them even though they never venture outside. A vaccine for this bacteria is often part of the fvrcp shot.</p>
