<p>First, there can be the presence of a watery discharge coming from your cat’s eyes. Currently treating one of the cats for what i think was an infection in both eyes caused by a scratch, possibly inside one of the eyes. Allergies can cause cat watery eyes. As there were so many causes that create eye discharge in cats i needed to know the different types of eye discharge in cats to find out what watering eyes is associated with. Drain your cat’s nasal passages with warm moist air with the help of a vaporizer.</p>

<p>When a cat has a flat face, a small nose and large, round eyes, the tears tend to spill over the eye rims. The below remedies will help with eye discharge, eyes that are matted shut, swollen eyes, and other signs of an eye infection in cats. They may present as red or swollen, much like your own eye would if it were irritated. Other signs of an eye ulcer include red eyes, sensitivity to light, squinting or blinking, rubbing the eyes with the paw, the third eyelid remaining visible or cloudiness of the eye. After a day or so the cat begins to sneeze, both eyes are sore and weeping and there is a clear discharge from the nose.</p>
