<p>In big cat species, however, the hyoid bone is only partly ossified, and this fundamentally changes what noises the animal can make. Thus, it has parents with the same genus but of different species.

However, the genus panthera can all interbreed, and pumas can interbreed with leopards. The tigon’s genome includes genetic components of both parents.</p>
