Cats are generally less keen on drinking water, so wet food is great for keeping cats hydrated.”. Thus, cat milk is the safest milk option for cats that is available. Some cats can tolerate it, but most cats are lactose intolerant and they should not have it as a part of their diet.</p>

Condensed milk is very, very sweet, which is not at all good for your cat. Of course, like humans some cats have no issue digesting milk. The bad far outweighs the good, and you want to avoid giving your cat things that will upset their stomachs.

<p>It seems natural to give cats milk. Most kitties love it, and in the past, it was regarded as traditional food for most housecats. But this idea is like folklore.

<p>Baby mammals, like kittens, produce enough lactase that they can digest their mother�s milk.but as they wean off of their mother�s milk—at four to six weeks of age, on average—and grow into adulthood, they begin to produce less lactase and lose the ability to properly digest milk. In general, you should avoid giving cats whole cow�s milk or cream because of the higher fat and sugar content. Cats are attracted to the cream that settles on top of a bowl especially when the milk is derived directly from a cow. However, they still shouldn’t be given it regularly as cow’s milk adds an unhealthy amount of fat to a cat’s diet without any nutritional benefits. Cream is rich in fats that cats find particularly enjoyable.</p>

<p>Evaporated milks resemble mother cats� milk. The answer is yes, they can — but it doesn�t mean they should.
